<h2>CHAPTER I.&nbsp; TWO GENERATIONS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Why all delights are vain, but that
most vain<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which with pain purchased
doth inherit pain.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear&mdash;Madam&mdash;what you call heart does not come
into the question at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John Meredith was sitting slightly behind Lady Cantourne, leaning
towards her with a somewhat stiffened replica of his former grace.&nbsp;
But he was not looking at her&mdash;and she knew it.</p>
<p>They were both watching a group at the other side of the great ballroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir John Meredith on Heart,&rdquo; said the old lady, with
a depth of significance in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed.&nbsp; Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John smiled with that well-bred cynicism which a new school has
not yet succeeded in imitating.&nbsp; They were of the old school, these
two; and their worldliness, their cynicism, their conversational attitude,
belonged to a bygone period.&nbsp; It was a cleaner period in some ways&mdash;a
period devoid of slums.&nbsp; Ours, on the contrary, is an age of slums
wherein we all dabble to the detriment of our hands&mdash;mental, literary,
and theological.</p>
<p>Sir John moved slightly in his chair, leaning one hand on one knee.&nbsp;
His back was very flat, his clothes were perfect, his hair was not his
own, nor yet his teeth.&nbsp; But his manners were entirely his own.&nbsp;
His face was eighty years old, and yet he smiled his keen society smile
with the best of them.&nbsp; There was not a young man in the room of
whom he was afraid, conversationally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Lady Cantourne,&rdquo; he repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your
charming niece is heartless.&nbsp; She will get on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Cantourne smiled, and drew the glove further up her stout and
motherly right arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will get on,&rdquo; she admitted.&nbsp; &ldquo;As to the
other, it is early to give an opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has had the best of trainings&mdash;,&rdquo; he murmured.&nbsp;
And Lady Cantourne turned on him with a twinkle amidst the wrinkles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For which?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Choisissez</i>!&rdquo; he answered, with a bow.</p>
<p>One sees a veteran swordsman take up the foil with a tentative turn
of the wrist, lunging at thin air.&nbsp; His zest for the game has gone;
but the skill lingers, and at times he is tempted to show the younger
blades a pass or two.&nbsp; These were veteran fencers with a skill
of their own, which they loved to display at times.&nbsp; The zest was
that of remembrance; the sword-play of words was above the head of a
younger generation given to slang and music-hall airs; and so these
two had little bouts for their own edification, and enjoyed the glitter
of it vastly.</p>
<p>Sir John&rsquo;s face relaxed into the only repose he ever allowed
it; for he had a habit of twitching and moving his lips such as some
old men have.&nbsp; And occasionally, in an access of further senility,
he fumbled with his fingers at his mouth.&nbsp; He was clean shaven,
and even in his old age he was handsome beyond other men&mdash;standing
an upright six feet two.</p>
<p>The object of his attention was the belle of that ball, Miss Millicent
Chyne, who was hemmed into a corner by a group of eager dancers anxious
to insert their names in some corner of her card.&nbsp; She was the
fashion at that time.&nbsp; And she probably did not know that at least
half of the men crowded round because the other half were there.&nbsp;
Nothing succeeds like the success that knows how to draw a crowd.</p>
<p>She received the ovation self-possessedly enough, but without that
hauteur affected by belles of balls&mdash;in books.&nbsp; She seemed
to have a fresh smile for each new applicant&mdash;a smile which conveyed
to each in turn the fact that she had been attempting all along to get
her programme safely into his hands.&nbsp; A halting masculine pen will
not be expected to explain how she compassed this, beyond a gentle intimation
that masculine vanity had a good deal to do with her success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is having an excellent time,&rdquo; said Sir John, weighing
on the modern phrase with a subtle sarcasm.&nbsp; He was addicted to
the use of modern phraseology, spiced with a cynicism of his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I cannot help sympathising with her&mdash;a little,&rdquo;
answered the lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I.&nbsp; It will not last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she is only gathering the rosebuds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wisely so, your ladyship.&nbsp; They at least <i>look</i>
as if they were going to last.&nbsp; The full-blown roses do not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Cantourne gave a little sigh.&nbsp; This was the difference
between them.&nbsp; She could not watch without an occasional thought
for a time that was no more.&nbsp; The man seemed to be content that
the past had been lived through and would never renew itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;she is my sister&rsquo;s
child.&nbsp; The sympathy may only be a matter of blood.&nbsp; Perhaps
I was like that myself once.&nbsp; Was I?&nbsp; You can tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked slowly round the room and his face hardened.&nbsp; He
knew that she was reflecting that there was no one else who could tell
her; and he did not like it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered readily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what was the difference?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked straight in front of her with a strange old-fashioned
demureness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their name is legion, for they are many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name a few.&nbsp; Was I as good-looking as that, for instance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled&mdash;a wise, old, woman-searching smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were better-looking than that,&rdquo; he said, with a
glance beneath his lashless lids.&nbsp; &ldquo;Moreover, there was more
of the grand lady about you.&nbsp; You behaved better.&nbsp; There was
less shaking hands with your partners, less nodding and becking, and
none of that modern forwardness which is called, I believe, <i>camaraderie</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Sir John,&rdquo; she answered, looking at him frankly
with a pleasant smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it is probable that we had the
faults of our age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fumbled at his lips, having reasons of his own for disliking too
close a scrutiny of his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is more than probable,&rdquo; he answered, rather indistinctly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; she said, tapping the back of his gloved hand
with her fan, &ldquo;we ought to be merciful to the faults of a succeeding
generation.&nbsp; Tell me who is that young man with the long stride
who is getting himself introduced now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; answered Sir John, who prided himself upon knowing
every one&mdash;knowing who they were and who they were not&mdash;&ldquo;is
young Oscard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Son of the eccentric Oscard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Son of the eccentric Oscard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where did he get that brown face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He got that in Africa, where he has been shooting.&nbsp; He
forms part of some one else&rsquo;s bag at the present moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been apportioned a dance.&nbsp; Your fair niece has
bagged him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If he had only known it, Guy Oscard won the privilege of a waltz
by the same brown face which Lady Cantourne had so promptly noted.&nbsp;
Coupled with a sturdy uprightness of carriage, this raised him at a
bound above the pallid habitu&eacute;s of ballroom and pavement.&nbsp;
It was, perhaps, only natural that Millicent Chyne should have noted
this man as soon as he crossed the threshold.&nbsp; He was as remarkable
as some free and dignified denizen of the forest in the midst of domestic
animals.&nbsp; She mentally put him down for a waltz, and before five
minutes had elapsed he was bowing before her while a mutual friend murmured
his name.&nbsp; One does not know how young ladies manage these little
affairs, but the fact remains that they are managed.&nbsp; Moreover,
it is a singular thing that the young persons who succeed in the ballroom
rarely succeed on the larger and rougher floor of life.&nbsp; Your belle
of the ball, like your Senior Wrangler, never seems to do much afterwards&mdash;and
Afterwards is Life.</p>
<p>The other young men rather fell back before Guy Oscard&mdash;scared,
perhaps, by his long stride, and afraid that he might crush their puny
toes.&nbsp; This enabled Miss Chyne to give him the very next dance,
of which the music was commencing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel rather out of all this,&rdquo; said Oscard, as they
moved away together.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must excuse uncouthness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see no signs of it,&rdquo; laughed Millicent.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
are behaving very nicely.&nbsp; You cannot help being larger and stronger
than&mdash;the others.&nbsp; I should say it was an advantage and something
to be proud of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is not that,&rdquo; replied Oscard; &ldquo;it is a
feeling of unkemptness and want of smartness among these men who look
so clean and correct.&nbsp; Shall we dance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked down at her, with an admiration which almost amounted to
awe, as if afraid of entering the throng with such a dainty and wonderful
charge upon his powers of steering.&nbsp; Millicent Chyne saw the glance
and liked it.&nbsp; It was different from the others, quite devoid of
criticism, rather simple and full of honest admiration.&nbsp; She was
so beautiful that she could hardly be expected to be unaware of the
fact.&nbsp; She had merely to make comparisons, to look in the mirror
and see that her hair was fairer and softer, that her complexion was
more delicately perfect, that her slight, rounded figure was more graceful
than any around her.&nbsp; Added to this, she knew that she had more
to say than other girls&mdash;a larger stock of those little frivolous,
advice-seeking, aid-demanding nothings than her compeers seemed to possess.</p>
<p>She knew that in saying them she could look brighter and prettier
and more intelligent than her competitors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;let us dance by all means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here also she knew her own proficiency, and in a few seconds she
found that her partner was worthy of her skill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo; she asked presently.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am sure you have been away somewhere, exploring or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have only been in Africa, shooting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how interesting!&nbsp; You must tell me all about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; replied Guy Oscard, with a somewhat shy
laugh, &ldquo;that that would <i>not</i> be interesting.&nbsp; Besides,
I could not tell you now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but some other time.&nbsp; I suppose you are not going
back to Africa to-morrow, Mr. Oscard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite.&nbsp; And perhaps we may meet somewhere else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; replied Miss Chyne.&nbsp; &ldquo;Besides,
you know my aunt, Lady Cantourne.&nbsp; I live with her, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know her slightly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then take an opportunity of improving the acquaintanceship.&nbsp;
She is sitting under the ragged banner over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Millicent Chyne indicated the direction with a nod of the head, and
while he looked she took the opportunity of glancing hastily round the
room.&nbsp; She was seeking some one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Oscard, &ldquo;I see her, talking to an old
gentleman who looks like Voltaire.&nbsp; I shall give her a chance of
recognising me before the evening is out.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mind being
snubbed if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused and steered neatly through a narrow place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If what?&rdquo; she asked, when they were in swing again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it means seeing you again,&rdquo; he answered bluntly&mdash;more
bluntly than she was accustomed to.&nbsp; But she liked it.&nbsp; It
was a novelty after the smaller change of ballroom compliments.</p>
<p>She was watching the door all the while.</p>
<p>Presently the music ceased and they made their way back to the spot
whence he had taken her.&nbsp; She led the way thither by an almost
imperceptible pressure of her fingers on his arm.&nbsp; There were several
men waiting there, and one or two more entering the room and looking
languidly round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There comes the favoured one,&rdquo; Lady Cantourne muttered,
with a veiled glance towards her companion.</p>
<p>Sir John&rsquo;s grey eyes followed the direction of her glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My bright boy?&rdquo; he inquired, with a wealth of sarcasm
on the adjective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your bright boy,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; he said curtly.</p>
<p>They were watching a tall fair man in the doorway who seemed to know
everybody, so slow was his progress into the room.&nbsp; The most remarkable
thing about this man was a certain grace of movement.&nbsp; He seemed
to be specially constructed to live in narrow, hampered places.&nbsp;
He was above six feet; but, being of slight build, he moved with a certain
languidness which saved him from that unwieldiness usually associated
with large men in a drawing-room.</p>
<p>Such was Jack Meredith, one of the best known figures in London society.&nbsp;
He had hitherto succeeded in moving through the mazes of that coterie,
as he now moved through this room, without jarring against any one.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER II.&nbsp; OVER THE OLD GROUND</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>A man who never makes mistakes never
makes anything else either.</i></p>
<p>Miss Millicent Chyne was vaguely conscious of success&mdash;and such
a consciousness is apt to make the best of us a trifle elated.&nbsp;
It was certainly one of the best balls of the season, and Miss Chyne&rsquo;s
dress was, without doubt, one of the most successful articles of its
sort there.</p>
<p>Jack Meredith saw that fact and noted it as soon as he came into
the room.&nbsp; Moreover, it gratified him, and he was pleased to reflect
that he was no mean critic in such matters.&nbsp; There could be no
doubt about it, because he <i>knew</i> as well as any woman there.&nbsp;
He knew that Millicent Chyne was dressed in the latest fashion&mdash;no
furbished-up gown from the hands of her maid, but a unique creation
from Bond Street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she asked in a low voice, as she handed him her
programme, &ldquo;are you pleased with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eminently so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She glanced down at her own dress.&nbsp; It was not the nervous glance
of the <i>d&eacute;butante</i>, but the practised flash of experienced
eyes which see without appearing to look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>He handed her back the card with the orthodox smile and bow of gratitude,
but there was something more in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that what you did it for?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; with a glance half coquettish, half humble.</p>
<p>She took the card and allowed it to drop pendent from her fan without
looking at it.&nbsp; He had written nothing on it.&nbsp; This was all
a form.&nbsp; The dances that were his had been inscribed on the engagement-card
long before by smaller fingers than his.</p>
<p>She turned to take her attendant partner&rsquo;s arm with a little
flaunt&mdash;a little movement of the hips to bring her dress, and possibly
herself, more prominently beneath Jack Meredith&rsquo;s notice.&nbsp;
His eyes followed her with that incomparably pleasant society smile
which he had no doubt inherited from his father.&nbsp; Then he turned
and mingled with the well-dressed throng, bowing where he ought to bow&mdash;asking
with fervour for dances in plain but influential quarters where dances
were to be easily obtained.</p>
<p>And all the while his father and Lady Cantourne watched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I <i>think</i>,&rdquo; the lady was saying, &ldquo;that
that is the favoured one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I noticed,&rdquo; observed Lady Cantourne, &ldquo;that he
asked for a dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And apparently got one&mdash;or more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apparently so, Sir John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moreover&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Cantourne turned on him with her usual vivacity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moreover?&rdquo; she repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not need to write it down on the card; it was written
there already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She closed her fan with a faint smile</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sometimes wonder,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;whether, in our
young days, you were so preternaturally observant as you are now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I was not.&nbsp; I affected
scales of the very opaquest description, like the rest of my kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime this man&rsquo;s son was going about his business
with a leisurely <i>savoir-faire</i> which few could rival.&nbsp; Jack
Meredith was the beau-ideal of the society man in the best acceptation
of the word.&nbsp; One met him wherever the best people congregated,
and he invariably seemed to know what to do and how to do it better
than his compeers.&nbsp; If it was dancing in the season, Jack Meredith
danced, and no man rivalled him.&nbsp; If it was grouse shooting, Jack
Meredith held his gun as straight as any man.&nbsp; All the polite accomplishments
in their season seemed to come to him without effort; but there was
in all the same lack of heart&mdash;that utter want of enthusiasm which
imparted to his presence a subtle suggestion of boredom.&nbsp; The truth
was that he was over-educated.&nbsp; Sir John had taught him how to
live and move and have his being with so minute a care, so keen an insight,
that existence seemed to be nothing but an habitual observance of set
rules.</p>
<p>Sir John called him sarcastically his &ldquo;bright boy,&rdquo; his
&ldquo;hopeful offspring,&rdquo; the &ldquo;pride of his old age&rdquo;;
but somewhere in his shrivelled old heart there nestled an unbounded
love and admiration for his son.&nbsp; Jack had assimilated his teaching
with a wonderful aptitude.&nbsp; He had as nearly as possible realised
Sir John Meredith&rsquo;s idea of what an English gentleman should be,
and the old aristocrat&rsquo;s standard was uncompromisingly high.&nbsp;
Public school, University, and two years on the Continent had produced
a finished man, educated to the finger-tips, deeply read, clever, bright,
and occasionally witty; but Jack Meredith was at this time nothing more
than a brilliant conglomerate of possibilities.&nbsp; He had obeyed
his father to the letter with a conscientiousness bred of admiration.&nbsp;
He had always felt that his father knew best.&nbsp; And now he seemed
to be waiting&mdash;possibly for further orders.&nbsp; He was suggestive
of a perfect piece of mechanism standing idle for want of work delicate
enough to be manipulated by its delicate craft.&nbsp; Sir John had impressed
upon him the desirability of being independent, and he had promptly
cultivated that excellent quality, taking kindly enough to rooms of
his own in a fashionable quarter.&nbsp; But upon the principle of taking
a horse to the water and being unable to make him drink, Sir John had
not hitherto succeeded in making Jack take the initiative.&nbsp; He
had turned out such a finished and polished English gentleman as his
soul delighted in, and now he waited in cynical silence for Jack Meredith
to take his life into his own hands and do something brilliant with
it.&nbsp; All that he had done up to now had been to prove that he could
attain to a greater social popularity than any other man of his age
and station; but this was not exactly the success that Sir John Meredith
coveted for his son.&nbsp; He had tasted of this success himself, and
knew its thinness of flavour&mdash;its fleeting value.</p>
<p>Behind his keen old eyes such thoughts as these were passing, while
he watched Jack go up and claim his dance at the hands of Miss Millicent
Chyne.&nbsp; He could almost guess what they said; for Jack was grave
and she smiled demurely.&nbsp; They began dancing at once, and as soon
as the floor became crowded they disappeared.</p>
<p>Jack Meredith was an adept at such matters.&nbsp; He knew a seat
at the end of a long passage where they could sit, the beheld of all
beholders who happened to pass; but no one could possibly overhear their
conversation&mdash;no one could surprise them.&nbsp; It was essentially
a strategical position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; inquired Jack, with a peculiar breathlessness,
when they were seated, &ldquo;have you thought about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave a little nod.</p>
<p>They seemed to be taking up some conversation at a point where it
had been dropped on a previous occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And?&rdquo; he inquired suavely.&nbsp; The society polish
was very thickly coated over the man; but his eyes had a hungry look.</p>
<p>By way of reply her gloved hand crept out towards his, which rested
on the chair at his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack!&rdquo; she whispered; and that was all.</p>
<p>It was very prettily done, and quite naturally.&nbsp; He was a judge
of such matters, and appreciated the girlish simplicity of the action.</p>
<p>He took the small gloved hand and pressed it lovingly.&nbsp; The
thoroughness of his social training prevented any further display of
affection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank Heaven!&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>They were essentially of the nineteenth century&mdash;these two.&nbsp;
At a previous dance he had asked her to marry him; she had deferred
her answer, and now she had given it.&nbsp; These little matters are
all a question of taste.&nbsp; We do not kneel nowadays, either physically
or morally.&nbsp; If we are a trifle off hand, it is the women who are
to blame.&nbsp; They should not write in magazines of a doubtful reputation
in language devoid of the benefit of the doubt.&nbsp; They are equal
to us.&nbsp; <i>Bien</i>!&nbsp; One does not kneel to an equal.&nbsp;
A better writer than any of us says that men serve women kneeling, and
when they get to their feet they go away.&nbsp; We are being hauled
up to our feet now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;?&rdquo; began the girl, and went no further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be difficulties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; he answered, with quiet mockery.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
always are.&nbsp; I will see to them.&nbsp; Difficulties are not without
a certain advantage.&nbsp; They keep one on the alert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father,&rdquo; said the girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir John&mdash;he
will object.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack Meredith reflected for a moment, lazily, with that leisureliness
which gave a sense of repose to his presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; he admitted gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He dislikes me,&rdquo; said the girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is one
of my failures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not know you had any.&nbsp; Have you tried?&nbsp; I
cannot quite admit the possibility of failure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Millicent Chyne smiled.&nbsp; He had emphasised the last remark with
lover-like glance and tone.&nbsp; She was young enough; her own beauty
was new enough to herself to blind her to the possibility mentioned.&nbsp;
She had not even got to the stage of classifying as dull all men who
did not fall in love with her at first sight.&nbsp; It was her first
season, one must remember.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not tried very hard,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
I don&rsquo;t see why I should not fail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is easily explained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No looking-glass about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave a little pout, but she liked it.</p>
<p>The music of the next dance was beginning, and, remembering their
social obligations, they both rose.&nbsp; She laid her hand on his arm,
and for a moment his fingers pressed hers.&nbsp; He smiled down into
her upturned eyes with love, but without passion.&nbsp; He never for
a second risked the &ldquo;gentleman&rdquo; and showed the &ldquo;man.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He was suggestive of a forest pool with a smiling rippled surface.&nbsp;
There might be depth, but it was yet unpenetrated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we go now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and say a few words
in passing to my redoubtable father?&nbsp; It might be effective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you like,&rdquo; she answered promptly.&nbsp; There
is no more confident being on earth than a pretty girl in a successful
dress.</p>
<p>They met Sir John at the entrance of the ballroom.&nbsp; He was wandering
about, taking in a vast deal of detail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, young lady,&rdquo; he said, with an old-world bow, &ldquo;are
you having a successful evening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Millicent laughed.&nbsp; She never knew quite how to take Sir John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so, thank you,&rdquo; she answered, with a pretty
smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am enjoying myself very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was just the least suggestion of shyness in her manner, and
it is just possible that this softened the old cynic&rsquo;s heart,
for his manner was kinder and almost fatherly when he spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;at your time of life you do not
want much&mdash;plenty of partners and a few ices.&nbsp; Both easily
obtainable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last words were turned into a compliment by the courtly inclination
of the head that accompanied them.</p>
<p>The exigencies of the moment forced the young people to go with the
stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; said Sir John, as they passed on, &ldquo;when
you have been deprived of Miss Chyne&rsquo;s society, come and console
yourself with a glass of sherry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dutiful son nodded a semi-indifferent acquiescence and disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful thing, sherry!&rdquo; observed Sir John Meredith
for his own edification.</p>
<p>He waited there until Jack returned, and then they set off in search
of refreshment.&nbsp; The son seemed to know his whereabouts better
than the father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;through the conservatory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amidst the palms and tropical ferns Sir John paused.&nbsp; A great
deal of care had been devoted to this conservatory.&nbsp; Half hidden
among languorous scented flowers were a thousand tiny lights, while
overhead in the gloom towered graceful palms and bananas.&nbsp; A fountain
murmured pleasantly amidst a cluster of maidenhairs.&nbsp; The music
from the ballroom fell softly over all.</p>
<p>Sir John Meredith and his son stood in silence, looking around them.&nbsp;
Finally their eyes met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you in earnest with that girl?&rdquo; asked Sir John abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; replied Jack.&nbsp; He was smiling pleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you think there is a chance of her marrying you&mdash;unless,
of course, something better turns up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all due modesty I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John&rsquo;s hand was at his mouth.&nbsp; He stood up his full
six feet two and looked hard at his son, whose eyes were level with
his own.&nbsp; They were ideal representatives of their school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you propose marrying upon?&nbsp; She, I understand,
has about eight hundred a year.&nbsp; I respect you too much to suspect
any foolish notions of love in a cottage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack Meredith made no reply.&nbsp; He was entirely dependent upon
his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Sir John, &ldquo;when I die you will
be a baronet, and there will be enough to live on like a gentleman.&nbsp;
You had better tell Miss Chyne that.&nbsp; She may not know it.&nbsp;
Girls are so innocent.&nbsp; But I am not dead yet, and I shall take
especial care to live some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In order to prevent my marriage?&rdquo; suggested Jack.&nbsp;
He was still smiling, and somehow Sir John felt a little uneasy.&nbsp;
He did not understand that smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely so,&rdquo; he said, rather indistinctly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your objection?&rdquo; inquired Jack Meredith, after
a little pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I object to the girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon what grounds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should prefer you to marry a woman of heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heart?&rdquo; repeated Jack, with a suspicion of hereditary
cynicism.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not think heart is of much consequence.&nbsp;
Besides, in this case, surely that is my province! you would not have
her wear it on her sleeve?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She could not do that: not enough sleeve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John Meredith had his own views on ladies&rsquo; dress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;we will not quarrel.&nbsp; Arrange
matters with the young lady as best you can.&nbsp; I shall never approve
of such a match, and without my approval you cannot well marry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not admit that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your approval means money,&rdquo; explained this dutiful son
politely.&nbsp; &ldquo;I might manage to make the money for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John moved away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might,&rdquo; he admitted, looking back.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
should be very glad to see you doing so.&nbsp; It is an excellent thing&mdash;money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he walked leisurely away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.&nbsp; A FAREWELL</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since
called<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paradise of Fools, to
few unknown.</i></p>
<p>Having been taught to take all the chances and changes of life with
a well-bred calmness of demeanour, Jack Meredith turned the teaching
against the instructor.&nbsp; He pursued the course of his social duties
without appearing to devote so much as a thought to the quarrel which
had taken place in the conservatory.&nbsp; His smile was as ready as
ever, his sight as keen where an elderly lady looked hungry, his laughter
as near the surface as society demands.&nbsp; It is probable that Sir
John suffered more, though he betrayed nothing.&nbsp; Youth has the
upper hand in these cases, for life is a larger thing when we are young.&nbsp;
As we get on in years, our eggs, to use a homely simile, have a way
of accumulating into one basket.</p>
<p>At eleven o&rsquo;clock the next morning Sir John Meredith&rsquo;s
valet intimated to his master that Mr. Meredith was waiting in the breakfast-room.&nbsp;
Sir John was in the midst of his toilet&mdash;a complicated affair,
which, like other works of art, would not bear contemplation when incomplete.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; said the uncompromising old gentleman, &ldquo;that
I will come down when I am ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made a more careful toilet than usual, and finally came down in
a gay tweed suit, of which the general effect was distinctly heightened
by a pair of white gaiters.&nbsp; He was upright, trim, and perfectly
determined.&nbsp; Jack noted that his clothes looked a little emptier
than usual&mdash;that was all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the father, &ldquo;I suppose we both made
fools of ourselves last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not yet seen you do that,&rdquo; replied the son, laying
aside the morning paper which he had been reading.</p>
<p>Sir John smiled grimly.&nbsp; He hoped that Jack was right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;let us call it a difference
of opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something in the monosyllable made the old gentleman&rsquo;s lips
twitch nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may mention,&rdquo; he said, with a dangerous suavity, &ldquo;that
I still hold to my opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack Meredith rose, without haste.&nbsp; This, like the interview
of the previous night, was conducted upon strictly high-bred and gentlemanly
lines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I to mine,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is why I
took the liberty of calling at this early hour.&nbsp; I thought that
perhaps we might effect some sort of a compromise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very good of you to make the proposal.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Sir John kept his fingers away from his lips by an obvious exercise
of self-control.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not partial to compromises: they
savour of commerce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack gave a queer, curt nod, and moved towards the door.&nbsp; Sir
John extended his unsteady hand and rang the bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Graves,&rdquo; he added, to the servant who stood in the doorway,
&ldquo;when you have closed the door behind Mr. Meredith, bring up breakfast,
if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the doorstep Jack Meredith looked at his watch.&nbsp; He had an
appointment with Millicent Chyne at half-past eleven&mdash;an hour when
Lady Cantourne might reasonably be expected to be absent at the weekly
meeting of a society which, under the guise and nomenclature of friendship,
busied itself in making servant girls discontented with their situations.</p>
<p>It was only eleven o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Jack turned to the left,
out of the quiet but fashionable street, and a few steps took him to
Piccadilly.&nbsp; He went into the first jeweller&rsquo;s shop he saw,
and bought a plain diamond ring.&nbsp; Then he walked on to keep his
appointment with his affianced wife.</p>
<p>Miss Millicent Chyne was waiting for him with that mixture of maidenly
feelings of which the discreet novelist only details a selection.&nbsp;
It is not customary to dwell upon thoughts of vague regret at the approaching
withdrawal of a universal admiration&mdash;at the future necessity for
discreet and humdrum behaviour quite devoid of the excitement that lurks
in a double meaning.&nbsp; Let it, therefore, be ours to note the outward
signs of a very natural emotion.&nbsp; Miss Chyne noted them herself
with care, and not without a few deft touches to hair and dress.&nbsp;
When Jack Meredith entered the room she was standing near the window,
holding back the curtain with one hand and watching, half shyly, for
his advent.</p>
<p>What struck her at once was his gravity; and he must have seen the
droop in her eyes, for he immediately assumed the pleasant, half-reckless
smile which the world of London society had learnt to associate with
his name.</p>
<p>He played the lover rather well, with that finish and absence of
self-consciousness which only comes from sincerity; and when Miss Chyne
found opportunity to look at him a second time she was fully convinced
that she loved him.&nbsp; She was, perhaps, carried off her feet a little&mdash;metaphorically
speaking, of course&mdash;by his evident sincerity.&nbsp; At that moment
she would have done anything that he had asked her.&nbsp; The pleasures
of society, the social amenities of aristocratic life, seemed to have
vanished suddenly into thin air, and only love was left.&nbsp; She had
always known that Jack Meredith was superior in a thousand ways to all
her admirers.&nbsp; More gentlemanly, more truthful, honester, nobler,
more worthy of love.&nbsp; Beyond that, he was cleverer, despite a certain
laziness of disposition&mdash;more brilliant and more amusing.&nbsp;
He had always been to a great extent the chosen one; and yet it was
with a certain surprise and sense of unreality that she found what she
had drifted into.&nbsp; She saw the diamond ring, and looked upon it
with the beautiful emotions aroused by those small stones in the female
breast; but she did not seem to recognise her own finger within the
golden hoop.</p>
<p>It was at this moment&mdash;while she dwelt in this new unreal world&mdash;that
he elected to tell her of his quarrel with his father.&nbsp; And when
one walks through a maze of unrealities nothing seems to come amiss
or to cause surprise.&nbsp; He detailed the very words they had used,
and to Millicent Chyne it did not sound like a real quarrel such as
might affect two lives to their very end.&nbsp; It was not important.&nbsp;
It did not come into her life; for at that moment she did not know what
her life was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; said Jack Meredith, finishing his story, &ldquo;we
have begun badly&mdash;as badly as the most romantic might desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, theoretically it is consoling.&nbsp; But I am sorry,
Jack, very sorry.&nbsp; I hate quarrelling with anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t time as a rule.&nbsp; But the
old gentleman is so easy to quarrel with, he takes all the trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; she said, with pretty determination, &ldquo;you
must go and say you are sorry.&nbsp; Go now!&nbsp; I wish I could go
with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Meredith did not move.&nbsp; He was smiling at her in evident
admiration.&nbsp; She looked very pretty with that determined little
pout of the lips, and perhaps she knew it.&nbsp; Moreover, he did not
seem to attach so much importance to the thought as to the result&mdash;to
the mind as to the lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you do not know the old gentleman.&nbsp;
That is not our way of doing things.&nbsp; We are not expansive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His face was grave again, and she noticed it with a sudden throb
of misgiving.&nbsp; She did not want to begin taking life seriously
so soon.&nbsp; It was like going back to school in the middle of the
holidays.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it will be all right in a day or two, will it not?&nbsp;
It is not serious,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid it is serious, Millicent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took her hand with a gravity which made matters worse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pity!&rdquo; she exclaimed; and somehow both the words
and the speaker rang shallow.&nbsp; She did not seem to grasp the situation,
which was perhaps beyond her reach.&nbsp; But she did the next best
thing.&nbsp; She looked puzzled, pretty, and helpless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is to be done, Jack?&rdquo; she said, laying her two
hands on his breast and looking up pleadingly.</p>
<p>There was something in the man&rsquo;s clear-cut face&mdash;something
beyond aristocratic repose&mdash;as he looked down into her eyes&mdash;something
which Sir John Meredith might perhaps have liked to see there.&nbsp;
To all men comes, soon or late, the moment wherein their lives are suddenly
thrust into their own hands to shape or spoil, to make or mar.&nbsp;
It seemed that where a clever man had failed, this light-hearted girl
was about to succeed.&nbsp; Two small clinging hands on Jack Meredith&rsquo;s
breast had apparently wrought more than all Sir John&rsquo;s care and
foresight.&nbsp; At last the light of energy gleamed in Jack Meredith&rsquo;s
lazy eyes.&nbsp; At last he faced the &ldquo;initiative,&rdquo; and
seemed in no wise abashed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two things,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;a small choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first and the simplest,&rdquo; he went on in the tone
of voice which she had never quite fathomed&mdash;half cynical, half
amused&mdash;&ldquo;is to pretend that last night&mdash;never was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waited for her verdict.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will not do that,&rdquo; she replied softly; &ldquo;we
will take the other alternative, whatever it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She glanced up half shyly beneath her lashes, and he felt that no
difficulty could affright him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other is generally supposed to be very difficult,&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It means&mdash;waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she answered cheerfully, &ldquo;there is no hurry.&nbsp;
I do not want to be married yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waiting perhaps for years,&rdquo; he added&mdash;and he saw
her face drop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I am dependent on my father for everything.&nbsp;
We could not marry without his consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A peculiar, hard look crept into her eyes, and in some subtle way
it made her look older.&nbsp; After a little pause she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we can surely get that&mdash;between us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I propose doing without it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up&mdash;past him&mdash;out of the window.&nbsp; All the
youthfulness seemed to have left her face, but he did not appear to
see that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you do so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can work.&nbsp; I suppose I must be good for something&mdash;a
bountiful Providence must surely have seen to that.&nbsp; The difficulty
is to find out what it intends me for.&nbsp; We are not called in the
night nowadays to a special mission&mdash;we have to find it out for
ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what I should like you to be?&rdquo; she said,
with a bright smile and one of those sudden descents into shallowness
which he appeared to like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A politician.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I shall be a politician,&rdquo; he answered, with loverlike
promptness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be very nice,&rdquo; she said; and the castles
she at once began to build were not entirely aerial in their structure.</p>
<p>This was not a new idea.&nbsp; They had talked of politics before
as a possible career for himself.&nbsp; They had moved in a circle where
politics and politicians held a first place&mdash;a circle removed above
the glamour of art, and wherein Bohemianism was not reckoned an attraction.&nbsp;
She knew that behind his listlessness of manner he possessed a certain
steady energy, perfect self-command, and that combination of self-confidence
and indifference which usually attains success in the world.&nbsp; She
was ambitious not only for herself but for him, and she was shrewd enough
to know that the only safe outlet for a woman&rsquo;s ambition is the
channel of a husband&rsquo;s career.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it will mean waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, and then the worldly wisdom which he had learnt from his
father&mdash;that worldly wisdom which is sometimes called cynicism&mdash;prompted
him to lay the matter before her in its worst light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will mean waiting for a couple of years at least.&nbsp;
And for you it will mean the dulness of a long engagement, and the anomalous
position of an engaged girl without her rightful protector.&nbsp; It
will mean that your position in society will be quite different&mdash;that
half the world will pity you, while the other half thinks you&mdash;well,
a fool for your pains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I must go away.&nbsp;
That is the only way to get on in politics in these days.&nbsp; I must
go away and get a speciality.&nbsp; I must know more about some country
than any other man; and when I come back I must keep that country ever
before the eye of the intelligent British workman who reads the halfpenny
evening paper.&nbsp; That is fame&mdash;those are politics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed.&nbsp; There seemed to be no fear of her taking life
too seriously yet.&nbsp; And, truth to tell, he did not appear to wish
her to do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must not go very far,&rdquo; she said sweetly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Africa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Africa?&nbsp; That does not sound interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is interesting: moreover, it is the coming country.&nbsp;
I may be able to make money out there, and money is a necessity at present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not like it, Jack,&rdquo; she said in a foreboding voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When do you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At once&mdash;in fact, I came to say good-bye.&nbsp; It is
better to do these things very promptly&mdash;to disappear before the
onlookers have quite understood what is happening.&nbsp; When they begin
to understand they begin to interfere.&nbsp; They cannot help it.&nbsp;
I will write to Lady Cantourne if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I will tell her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he bade her good-bye, and those things that lovers say were duly
said; but they are not for us to chronicle.&nbsp; Such words are better
left to be remembered or forgotten as time and circumstance and result
may decree.&nbsp; For one may never tell what words will do when they
are laid within the years like the little morsel of leaven that leaveneth
the whole.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.&nbsp; A TRAGEDY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows? the man is proven by
the hour.</i></p>
<p>In his stately bedroom on the second floor of the quietest house
in Russell Square Mr. Thomas Oscard&mdash;the eccentric Oscard&mdash;lay,
perhaps, a-dying.</p>
<p>Thomas Oscard had written the finest history of an extinct people
that had ever been penned; and it has been decreed that he who writes
a fine history or paints a fine picture can hardly be too eccentric.&nbsp;
Our business, however, does not lie in the life of this historian&mdash;a
life which certain grave wiseacres from the West End had shaken their
heads over a few hours before we find him lying prone on a four-poster
counting for the thousandth time the number of tassels fringing the
roof of it.&nbsp; In bold contradiction to the medical opinion, the
nurse was, however, hopeful.&nbsp; Whether this comforting condition
of mind arose from long experience of the ways of doctors, or from an
acquired philosophy, it is not our place to inquire.&nbsp; But that
her opinion was sincere is not to be doubted.&nbsp; She had, as a matter
of fact, gone to the pantomime, leaving the patient under the immediate
eye of his son, Guy Oscard.</p>
<p>The temporary nurse was sitting in a cretonne-covered armchair, with
a book of travel on his knee, and thoughts of Millicent Chyne in his
mind.&nbsp; The astute have no doubt discovered ere this that the mind
of Mr. Guy Oscard was a piece of mental mechanism more noticeable for
solidity of structure than brilliancy or rapidity of execution.&nbsp;
Thoughts and ideas and principles had a strange way of getting mixed
up with the machinery, and sticking there.&nbsp; Guy Oscard had, for
instance, concluded some years before that the Winchester rifle was,
as he termed it, &ldquo;no go&rdquo;; and if the Pope of Rome and the
patentee of the firearm in question had crossed Europe upon their bended
knees to persuade him to use a Winchester rifle, he would have received
them with a pleasant smile and an offer of refreshment.&nbsp; He would
have listened to their arguments with that patience of manner which
characterises men of large stature, and for the rest of his days he
would have continued to follow big game with an &ldquo;Express&rdquo;
double-barrelled rifle as heretofore.&nbsp; Men who decide such small
matters as these for themselves, after mature and somewhat slow consideration,
have a way of also deciding the large issues of life without pausing
to consider either expediency or the experience of their neighbours.</p>
<p>During the last forty-eight hours Guy Oscard had made the decision
that life without Millicent Chyne would not be worth having, and in
the hush of the great house he was pondering over this new feature in
his existence.&nbsp; Like all deliberate men, he was placidly sanguine.&nbsp;
Something in the life of savage sport that he had led had no doubt taught
him to rely upon his own nerve and capacity more than do most men.&nbsp;
It is the indoor atmosphere that contains the germ of pessimism.</p>
<p>His thoughts cannot have been disturbing, for presently his eyes
closed and he appeared to be slumbering.&nbsp; If it was sleep, it was
the light unconsciousness of the traveller; for a sound so small, that
waking ears could scarce have heard it, caused him to lift his lashes
cautiously.&nbsp; It was the sound of bare feet on carpet.</p>
<p>Through his lashes Guy Oscard saw his father standing on the hearthrug
within two yards of him.&nbsp; There was something strange, something
unnatural and disturbing, about the movements of the man that made Guy
keep quite still&mdash;watching him.</p>
<p>Upon the mantelpiece the medicine bottles were arranged in a row,
and the &ldquo;eccentric Oscard&rdquo; was studying the labels with
a feverish haste.&nbsp; One bottle&mdash;a blue one&mdash;bore two labels:
the smaller, of brilliant orange colour, with the word &ldquo;Poison&rdquo;
in startling simplicity.&nbsp; He took this up and slowly drew the cork.&nbsp;
It was a liniment for neuralgic pains in an overwrought head&mdash;belladonna.&nbsp;
He poured some into a medicine-glass, carefully measuring two tablespoonsful.</p>
<p>Then Guy Oscard sprang up and wrenched the glass away from him, throwing
the contents into the fire, which flared up.&nbsp; Quick as thought
the bottle was at the sick man&rsquo;s lips.&nbsp; He was a heavily
built man with powerful limbs.&nbsp; Guy seized his arm, closed with
him, and for a moment there was a deadly struggle, while the pungent
odour of the poison filled the atmosphere.&nbsp; At last Guy fell back
on art: he tripped his father cleverly, and they both rolled on the
floor.</p>
<p>The sick man still gripped the bottle, but he could not get it to
his lips.&nbsp; He poured some of the stuff over his son&rsquo;s face,
but fortunately missed his eyes.&nbsp; They struggled on the floor in
the dim light, panting and gasping, but speaking no word.&nbsp; The
strength of the elder man was unnatural&mdash;it frightened the younger
and stronger combatant.</p>
<p>At last Guy Oscard got his knee on his father&rsquo;s neck, and bent
his wrist back until he was forced to let go his hold on the bottle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get back to bed!&rdquo; said the son breathlessly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Get
back to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thomas Oscard suddenly changed his tactics.&nbsp; He whined and cringed
to his own offspring, and begged him to give him the bottle.&nbsp; He
dragged across the floor on his knees&mdash;three thousand pounds a
year on its knees to Guy Oscard, who wanted that money because he knew
that he would never get Millicent Chyne without it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get back to bed!&rdquo; repeated Guy sternly, and at last
the man crept sullenly between the rumpled sheets.</p>
<p>Guy put things straight in a simple, man-like way.&nbsp; The doctor&rsquo;s
instructions were quite clear.&nbsp; If any sign of excitement or mental
unrest manifested itself, the sleeping-draught contained in a small
bottle on the mantelpiece was to be administered at once, or the consequences
would be fatal.&nbsp; But Thomas Oscard refused to take it.&nbsp; He
seemed determined to kill himself.&nbsp; The son stood over him and
tried threats, persuasion, prayers; and all the while there was in his
heart the knowledge that, unless his father could be made to sleep,
the reputed three thousand a year would be his before the morning.</p>
<p>It was worse than the actual physical struggle on the floor.&nbsp;
The temptation was almost too strong.</p>
<p>After a while the sick man became quieter, but he still refused to
take the opiate.&nbsp; He closed his eyes and made no answer to Guy&rsquo;s
repeated supplication.&nbsp; Finally he ceased shaking his head in negation,
and at last breathed regularly like a child asleep.</p>
<p>Afterwards Guy Oscard reproached himself for suspecting nothing.&nbsp;
But he knew nothing of brain diseases&mdash;those strange maladies that
kill the human in the human being.&nbsp; He knew, however, why his father
had tried to kill himself.&nbsp; It was not the first time.&nbsp; It
was panic.&nbsp; He was afraid of going mad, of dying mad like his father
before him.&nbsp; People called him eccentric.&nbsp; Some said that
he was mad.&nbsp; But it was not so.&nbsp; It was only fear of madness.&nbsp;
He was still asleep when the nurse came back from the pantomime in a
cab, and Guy crept softly downstairs to let her in.</p>
<p>They stood in the hall for some time while Guy told her in whispers
about the belladonna liniment.&nbsp; Then they went upstairs together
and found Thomas Oscard&mdash;the great historian&mdash;dead on the
floor.&nbsp; The liniment bottle, which Guy had left on the mantelpiece,
was in his hand&mdash;empty.&nbsp; He had feigned sleep in order to
carry out his purpose.&nbsp; He had preferred death, of which the meaning
was unknown to him, to the possibility of that living death in which
his father had lingered for many years.&nbsp; And who shall say that
his thoughts were entirely selfish?&nbsp; There may have been a father&rsquo;s
love somewhere in this action.&nbsp; Thomas Oscard, the eccentric <i>savant</i>,
had always been a strong man, independent of the world&rsquo;s opinion.&nbsp;
He had done this thing deliberately, of mature thought, going straight
to his Creator with his poor human brain full of argument and reason
to prove himself right before the Judge.</p>
<p>They picked him up and laid him reverently on the bed, and then Guy
went for the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could,&rdquo; said the attendant of Death, when he had heard
the whole story&mdash;&ldquo;I could give you a certificate.&nbsp; I
could reconcile it, I mean, with my professional conscience and my&mdash;other
conscience.&nbsp; He could not have lived thirty hours&mdash;there was
an abscess on his brain.&nbsp; But I should advise you to face the inquest.&nbsp;
It might be&rdquo;&mdash;he paused, looking keenly into the young fellow&rsquo;s
face&mdash;&ldquo;it might be that at some future date, when you are
quite an old man, you may feel inclined to tell this story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the doctor paused, glancing with a vague smile towards the
woman who stood beside them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Or even nurse&mdash;&rdquo;
he added, not troubling to finish his sentence. &ldquo;We all have our
moments of expansiveness.&nbsp; And it is a story that might easily
be&mdash;discredited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the &ldquo;eccentric Oscard&rdquo; finished his earthly career
in the intellectual atmosphere of a coroner&rsquo;s jury.&nbsp; And
the world rather liked it than otherwise.&nbsp; The world, one finds,
does like novelty, even in death.&nbsp; Some day an American will invent
a new funeral, and if he can only get the patent, will make a fortune.</p>
<p>The world was, moreover, pleased to pity Guy Oscard with that pure
and simple sympathy which is ever accorded to the wealthy in affliction.&nbsp;
Every one knew that Thomas Oscard had enjoyed affluence during his lifetime,
and there was no reason to suppose that Guy would not step into very
comfortably lined shoes.&nbsp; It was unfortunate that he should lose
his father in such a tragic way, and the keen eye of the world saw the
weak point in his story at once.&nbsp; But the coroner&rsquo;s jury
was respectful, and the rest of society never so much as hinted at the
possibility that Guy had not tried his best to keep his father alive.</p>
<p>Among the letters of sympathy, the young fellow received a note from
Lady Cantourne, whose acquaintance he had successfully renewed, and
in due course he called at her house in Vere Gardens to express somewhat
lamely his gratitude.</p>
<p>Her ladyship was at home, and Guy Oscard was ushered into her presence.&nbsp;
He looked round the room, with a half-suppressed gleam of searching
which was not overlooked by Millicent Chyne&rsquo;s aunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very good of you to call,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;so
soon after your poor father&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; You must have had a
great deal of trouble and worry.&nbsp; Millicent and I have often talked
of you, and sympathised with you.&nbsp; She is out at the moment, but
I expect her back almost at once.&nbsp; Will you sit down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he said; and after he had drawn forward a chair
he repeated the word vaguely and comprehensively&mdash;&ldquo;Thanks&rdquo;&mdash;as
if to cover as many demands for gratitude as she could make.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew your father very well,&rdquo; continued the lady, &ldquo;when
we were young.&nbsp; Great things were expected of him.&nbsp; Perhaps
he expected them himself.&nbsp; That may have accounted for a tone of
pessimism that always seemed to pervade his life.&nbsp; Now, you are
quite different.&nbsp; You are not a pessimist&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy gravely examined the back of his gloved hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
I am afraid I have not given much thought to the question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Cantourne gave him the benefit of a very wise smile.&nbsp; She
was unrivalled in the art of turning a young man&rsquo;s mind inside
out and shaking it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! you need not apologise.&nbsp; I am glad you have given
no thought to it.&nbsp; Thought is the beginning of pessimism, especially
with young men; for if they think at all, they naturally think of themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose I think as much of myself as other people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly; but I doubt it.&nbsp; Will you ring the bell?&nbsp;
We will have some tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He obeyed, and she watched him with approval.&nbsp; For some reason&mdash;possibly
because he had not sought it&mdash;Lady Cantourne had bestowed her entire
approval on this young man.&nbsp; She had been duly informed, a few
weeks before this visit, that Miss Millicent Chyne had engaged herself
to be married to Jack Meredith whenever that youth should find himself
in a position to claim the fulfilment of her promise.&nbsp; She said
nothing against the choice or the decision, merely observing that she
was sorry that Jack had quarrelled with his father.&nbsp; By way of
counsel she advised strongly that the engagement be kept as much in
the background as possible.&nbsp; She did not, she said, want Millicent
to be a sort of red rag to Sir John, and there was no necessity to publish
abroad the lamentable fact that a quarrel had resulted from a very natural
and convenient attachment.&nbsp; Sir John was a faddist, and, like the
rest of his kind, eminently pig-headed.&nbsp; It was more than likely
that in a few months he would recall his son, and, in the meantime,
it never did a girl any good to be quarrelled over.</p>
<p>Lady Cantourne was too clever a woman to object to the engagement.&nbsp;
On the contrary, she allowed it to be understood that such a match was
in many ways entirely satisfactory.&nbsp; At the same time, however,
she encouraged Guy Oscard to come to the house, knowing quite well that
he was entirely unaware of the existence of Jack Meredith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; she was in the habit of saying, &ldquo;a great
advocate for allowing young people to manage their affairs themselves.&nbsp;
One young man, if he be the right one, has more influence with a girl
than a thousand old women; and it is just possible that he knows better
than they do what is for her happiness.&nbsp; It is the interference
that makes mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she did not interfere.&nbsp; She merely invited Guy Oscard to
stay to tea.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.&nbsp; WITH EDGED TOOLS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Do
not give dalliance<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too much the rein;
the strongest oaths are straw<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
the fire i&rsquo; the blood.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you intend to do with yourself?&rdquo; asked Lady
Cantourne when she had poured out tea.&nbsp; &ldquo;You surely do not
intend to mope in that dismal house in Russell Square?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I shall let it if I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you will have no difficulty in doing that.&nbsp; People
live in Russell Square again now, and try to make one believe that it
is a fashionable quarter.&nbsp; Your father stayed on there because
the carpets fitted the rooms, and on account of other ancestral conveniences.&nbsp;
He did not live there&mdash;he knew nothing of his immediate environments.&nbsp;
He lived in Ph&oelig;nicia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; continued Guy Oscard, &ldquo;I shall go abroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Will you have a second cup?&nbsp; Why will you go
abroad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy Oscard paused for a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know an old hippopotamus
in a certain African river who has twice upset me.&nbsp; I want to go
back and shoot him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go at once; that would be running away from it&mdash;not
from the hippopotamus&mdash;from the inquest.&nbsp; It does not matter
being upset in an African river; but you must not be upset in London
by&mdash;an inquest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not propose going at once,&rdquo; replied Guy Oscard,
with a peculiar smile which Lady Cantourne thought she understood.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It will take me some time to set my affairs in order&mdash;the
will, and all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Cantourne waited with perfectly suppressed curiosity, and while
she was waiting Millicent Chyne came into the room.&nbsp; The girl was
dressed with her habitual perfect taste and success, and she came forward
with a smile of genuine pleasure, holding out a small hand neatly gloved
in Su&egrave;de.&nbsp; Her ladyship was looking not at Millicent, but
at Guy Oscard.</p>
<p>Millicent was glad that he had called, and said so.&nbsp; She did
not add that during the three months that had elapsed since Jack Meredith&rsquo;s
sudden departure she had gradually recognised the approaching ebb of
a very full tide of popularity.&nbsp; It was rather dull at times, when
Jack&rsquo;s letters arrived at intervals of two and sometimes of three
weeks&mdash;when her girl friends allowed her to see somewhat plainly
that she was no longer to be counted as one of themselves.&nbsp; An
engagement sits as it were on a young lady like a weak heart on a schoolboy,
setting her apart in work and play, debarring her from participation
in that game of life which is ever going forward where young folks do
congregate.</p>
<p>Moreover, she liked Guy Oscard.&nbsp; He aroused her curiosity.&nbsp;
There was something in him&mdash;something which she vaguely suspected
to be connected with herself&mdash;which she wanted to drag out and
examine.&nbsp; She possessed more than the usual allowance of curiosity&mdash;which
is saying a good deal; for one may take it that the beginning of all
things in the feminine mind is curiosity.&nbsp; They want to know what
is inside Love before they love.&nbsp; Guy Oscard was a new specimen
of the genus homo; and while remaining perfectly faithful to Jack, Miss
Millicent Chyne saw no reason why she should not pass the time by studying
him, merely, of course, in a safe and innocent manner.&nbsp; She was
one of those intelligent young ladies who think deeply&mdash;about young
men.&nbsp; And such thinking usually takes the form of speculation as
to how the various specimens selected will act under specified circumstances.&nbsp;
The circumstances need hardly be mentioned.&nbsp; Young men are only
interesting to young women in circumstances strictly personal to and
bearing upon themselves.&nbsp; In a word, maidens of a speculative mind
are always desirous of finding out how different men will act when they
are in love; and we all know and cannot fail to applaud the assiduity
with which they pursue their studies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Miss Chyne, &ldquo;it is very good of you
to take pity upon two lone females.&nbsp; I was afraid that you had
gone off to the wilds of America or somewhere in search of big game.&nbsp;
Do you know, Mr. Oscard, you are quite a celebrity?&nbsp; I heard you
called the &lsquo;big-game man&rsquo; the other day, also the &lsquo;travelling
fellow.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The specimen smiled happily under this delicate handling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not,&rdquo; he said modestly, &ldquo;a very lofty fame.&nbsp;
Anybody could let off a rifle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I could not,&rdquo; replied Millicent, with a
pretty little shudder of horror, &ldquo;if anything growled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Oscard has just been telling me,&rdquo; interposed Lady
Cantourne conversationally, &ldquo;that he is thinking of going off
to the wilds again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it is very disappointing of him,&rdquo; said Millicent,
with a little droop of the eyelids which went home.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
seems to be only the uninteresting people who stay at home and live
humdrum lives of enormous duration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems to think that his friends are going to cast him off
because his poor father died without the assistance of a medical man,&rdquo;
continued the old lady meaningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I never said that, Lady Cantourne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you implied it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy Oscard shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hate being a notoriety,&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I like to pass through with the crowd.&nbsp; If
I go away for a little while I shall return a nonentity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment another visitor was announced, and presently made
his appearance.&nbsp; He was an old gentleman of no personality whatever,
who was nevertheless welcomed effusively, because two people in the
room had a distinct use for him.&nbsp; Lady Cantourne was exceedingly
gracious.&nbsp; She remembered instantly that horticulture was among
his somewhat antiquated accomplishments, and she was immediately consumed
with a desire to show him the conservatory which she had had built outside
the drawing-room window.&nbsp; She took a genuine interest in this abode
of flowers, and watered the plants herself with much enthusiasm&mdash;when
she remembered.</p>
<p>Added to a number of positive virtues the old gentleman possessed
that of abstaining from tea, which enabled the two horticulturists to
repair to the conservatory at once, leaving the young people alone at
the other end of the drawing-room.</p>
<p>Millicent smoothed her gloves with downcast eyes and that demure
air by which the talented fair imply the consciousness of being alone
and out of others&rsquo; earshot with an interesting member of the stronger
sex.</p>
<p>Guy sat and watched the Su&egrave;de gloves with a certain sense
of placid enjoyment.&nbsp; Then suddenly he spoke, continuing his remarks
where they had been broken off by the advent of the useful old gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is only natural that a
great many people should give me the cold shoulder.&nbsp; My story was
a little lame.&nbsp; There is no reason why they should believe in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe in you,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her in a strange way, as if he liked her terse creed,
and would fain have heard it a second time.&nbsp; Then suddenly he leant
back with his head against a corner of the piano.&nbsp; The fronds of
a maidenhair fern hanging in delicate profusion almost hid his face.&nbsp;
He was essentially muscular in his thoughts, and did not make the most
of his dramatic effects.&nbsp; The next remark was made by a pair of
long legs ending off with patent-leather boots which were not quite
new.&nbsp; The rest of him was invisible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a very unpleasant business,&rdquo; he said, in a jerky,
self-conscious voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that I was that
sort of fellow.&nbsp; The temptation was very great.&nbsp; I nearly
gave in and let him do it.&nbsp; He was a stronger man than I.&nbsp;
You know&mdash;we did not get on well together.&nbsp; He always hoped
that I would turn out a literary sort of fellow, and I suppose he was
disappointed.&nbsp; I tried at one time, but I found it was no good.&nbsp;
From indifference it turned almost to hatred.&nbsp; He disliked me intensely,
and I am afraid I did not care for him very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded her head, and he went on.&nbsp; Perhaps he could see her
through the maidenhair fern.&nbsp; She was getting more and more interested
in this man.&nbsp; He obviously disliked talking of himself&mdash;a
pleasant change which aroused her curiosity.&nbsp; He was so unlike
other men, and his life seemed to be different from the lives of the
men whom she had known&mdash;stronger, more intense, and of greater
variety of incident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;his death was really
of enormous advantage to me.&nbsp; They say that I shall have two or
three thousand a year, instead of five hundred, paid quarterly at Cox&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
He could not prevent it coming to me.&nbsp; It was my mother&rsquo;s
money.&nbsp; He would have done so if he could, for we never disguised
our antipathy for each other.&nbsp; Yet we lived together, and&mdash;and
I had the nursing of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Millicent was listening gravely without interrupting&mdash;like a
man.&nbsp; She had the gift of adapting herself to her environments
in a marked degree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; he added curtly, &ldquo;no one knows how much
I wanted that three thousand a year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl moved uneasily, and glanced towards the conservatory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was not an old man,&rdquo; Guy Oscard went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
was only forty-nine.&nbsp; He might have lived another thirty years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded, understanding the significance of his tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said, with an awkward laugh, &ldquo;do you
still believe in me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, still looking away.</p>
<p>There was a little pause.&nbsp; They were both sitting forward in
their chairs looking towards the conservatory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not the money that tempted me,&rdquo; said Guy very
deliberately; &ldquo;it was you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose from her chair as if to join her aunt and the horticultural
old gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not say that,&rdquo; she said, in little more than
a whisper, and without looking round she went towards Lady Cantourne.&nbsp;
Her eyes were gleaming with a singular suppressed excitement, such as
one sees in the eyes of a man fresh from a mad run across country.</p>
<p>Guy Oscard rose also, and followed more deliberately.&nbsp; There
was nothing for him to do but to take his leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Lady Cantourne graciously, &ldquo;if you
are determined to go away you must at least come and say good-bye before
you leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks; I should like to do so, if I may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall be deeply disappointed if you forget,&rdquo; said
Millicent, holding out her hand, with a smile full of light-heartedness
and innocent girlish friendship.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.&nbsp; UNDER THE LINE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Enough of simpering and grimace,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough
of vacuity, trimmed with lace.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Curse this country!&nbsp; Curse it&mdash;curse it!&rdquo;&nbsp;
The man spoke aloud, but there was no one near to hear.&nbsp; He shook
his skinny yellow fist out over the broad river that crept greasily
down to the equatorial sea.</p>
<p>All around him the vegetable kingdom had asserted its sovereignty.&nbsp;
At his back loomed a dense forest, impenetrable to the foot of man,
defying his puny hand armed with axe or saw.&nbsp; The trees were not
high, few of them being above twenty feet, but from their branches creepers
and parasites hung in tangled profusion, interlaced, joining tree to
tree for acres, nay for miles.</p>
<p>As far as the eye could reach either bank of the slow river was thus
covered with rank vegetation&mdash;mile after mile without variety,
without hope.&nbsp; The glassy surface of the water was broken here
and there by certain black forms floating like logs half hidden beneath
the wave.&nbsp; These were crocodiles.&nbsp; The river was the Ogowe,
and the man who cursed it was Victor Durnovo, <i>employ&eacute;</i>
of the Loango Trading Association, whose business it was at that season
to travel into the interior of Africa to buy, barter, or steal ivory
for his masters.</p>
<p>He was a small-faced man, with a squarely aquiline nose and a black
moustache, which hung like a valance over his mouth.&nbsp; From the
growth of that curtain-like moustache Victor Durnovo&rsquo;s worldly
prosperity might have been said to date.&nbsp; No one seeing his mouth
had before that time been prevailed upon to trust him.&nbsp; Nature
has a way of hanging out signs and then covering them up, so that the
casual fail to see.&nbsp; He was a man of medium height, with abnormally
long arms and a somewhat truculent way of walking, as if his foot was
ever ready to kick anything or any person who might come in his way.</p>
<p>His movements were nervous and restless, although he was tired out
and half-starved.&nbsp; The irritability of Africa was upon him&mdash;had
hold over him&mdash;gripped him remorselessly.&nbsp; No one knows what
it is, but it is there, and sometimes it is responsible for murder.&nbsp;
It makes honourable European gentlemen commit crimes of which they blush
to think in after days.&nbsp; The Powers may draw up treaties and sign
the same, but there will never be a peaceful division of the great wasted
land so near to Southern Europe.&nbsp; There may be peace in Berlin,
or Brussels, or London, but because the atmosphere of Africa is not
the same as that of the great cities, there will be no peace beneath
the Equator.&nbsp; From the West Coast of Africa to the East men will
fight and quarrel and bicker so long as human nerves are human nerves.&nbsp;
The irritability lurks in the shades of boundless forests where men
may starve for want of animal sustenance; it hovers over the broad bosoms
of a hundred slow rivers haunted by the mysterious crocodile, the weird
hippopotamus.&nbsp; It is everywhere, and by reason of it men quarrel
about trifles and descend to brutal passion over a futile discussion.</p>
<p>Victor Durnovo had sent his boatmen into the forest to find a few
bananas, a few handsful of firewood, and while they were absent he gave
vent to that wild unreasoning passion which is inhaled into the white
man&rsquo;s lungs with the air of equatorial Africa.&nbsp; For there
are moral microbes in the atmosphere of different countries, and we
must not judge one land by the laws of another.&nbsp; There is the fatalism
of India, the restlessness of New York, the fear of the Arctic, the
irritability of Africa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curse this country!&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;curse it&mdash;curse
it!&nbsp; River and tree&mdash;man and beast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose and slouched down to his boat, which lay moored to a snag
alongside the bank, trodden hard to the consistency of asphalte by a
hundred bare feet.&nbsp; He stepped over the gunwale and made his way
aft with a practised balancing step.&nbsp; The after part of the canoe
was decked in and closed with lock and key.&nbsp; The key hung at his
watch-chain&mdash;a large chain with square links and a suggestive doubtfulness
of colour.&nbsp; It might have been gold, but the man who wore it somehow
imparted to it a suggestion of baser metal.</p>
<p>He opened the locker and took from it a small chest.&nbsp; From this
he selected a bottle, and, rummaging in the recesses of the locker,
he found an unwashed tumbler.&nbsp; Into half a glass of water he dropped
a minute quantity from the bottle and drank off the mixture.&nbsp; The
passion had left him now, and quite suddenly he looked yellow and very
weak.&nbsp; He was treating himself scientifically for the irritability
to which he had given way.&nbsp; Then he returned to the bank and laid
down at full length.&nbsp; The skin of his face must have been giving
him great pain, for it was scarlet in places and exuding from sun-blisters.&nbsp;
He had long ago given up wiping the perspiration from his brow, and
evidently did not care to wash his face.</p>
<p>Presently a peacefulness seemed to come over him, for his eyes lost
their glitter and his heavy lids drooped.&nbsp; His arms were crossed
behind his head&mdash;before him lay the river.</p>
<p>Suddenly he sat upright, all eagerness and attention.&nbsp; Not a
leaf stirred.&nbsp; It was about five o&rsquo;clock in the evening,
the stillest hour of the twenty-four.&nbsp; In such a silence the least
sound would travel almost any distance, and there was a sound travelling
over the water to him.&nbsp; It was nothing but a thud repeated with
singular regularity; but to his practised ears it conveyed much.&nbsp;
He knew that a boat was approaching, as yet hidden by some distant curve
in the river.&nbsp; The thud was caused by the contact of six paddles
with the gunwale of the canoe as the paddlers withdrew them from the
water.</p>
<p>Victor Durnovo rose again and brought from the boat a second rifle,
which he laid beside the double-barrelled Reilly which was never more
than a yard away from him, waking or sleeping.&nbsp; Then he waited.&nbsp;
He knew that no boat could reach the bank without his full permission,
for every rower would be dead before they got within a hundred yards
of his rifle.&nbsp; He was probably the best rifle-shot but one in that
country&mdash;and the other, the very best, happened to be in the approaching
canoe.</p>
<p>After the space of ten minutes the boat came in sight&mdash;a long
black form on the still waters.&nbsp; It was too far away for him to
distinguish anything beyond the fact that it was a native boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight hundred yards,&rdquo; muttered Durnovo over the sight
of his rifle.</p>
<p>He looked upon this river as his own, and he knew the native of equatorial
Africa.&nbsp; Therefore he dropped a bullet into the water, under the
bow of the canoe, at eight hundred yards.</p>
<p>A moment later there was a sound which can only be written &ldquo;P-ttt&rdquo;
between his legs, and he had to wipe a shower of dust from his eyes.&nbsp;
A puff of blue smoke rose slowly over the boat and a sharp report broke
the silence a second time.</p>
<p>Then Victor Durnovo leapt to his feet and waved his hat in the air.&nbsp;
From the canoe there was an answering greeting, and the man on the bank
went to the water&rsquo;s edge, still carrying the rifle from which
he was never parted.</p>
<p>Durnovo was the first to speak when the boat came within hail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very sorry,&rdquo; he shouted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thought you were
a native boat.&nbsp; Must establish a funk&mdash;get in the first shot,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; replied one of the Europeans in the approaching
craft, with a courteous wave of the hand, &ldquo;no harm done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were two white men and six blacks in the long and clumsy boat.&nbsp;
One of the Europeans lay in the bows while the other was stretched at
his ease in the stern, reclining on the canvas of a neatly folded tent.&nbsp;
The last-named was evidently the leader of the little expedition, while
the manner and attitude of the man in the bows suggested the servitude
of a disciplined soldier slightly relaxed by abnormal circumstances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who fired that shot?&rdquo; inquired Durnovo, when there was
no longer any necessity to shout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joseph,&rdquo; replied the man in the stern of the boat, indicating
his companion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Was it a near thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About as near as I care about&mdash;it threw up the dust between
my legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man called Joseph grinned.&nbsp; Nature had given him liberally
of the wherewithal for indulgence in that relaxation, and Durnovo smiled
rather constrainedly.&nbsp; Joseph was grabbing at the long reedy grass,
bringing the canoe to a standstill, and it was some moments before his
extensive mouth submitted to control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I presume you are Mr. Durnovo,&rdquo; said the man in the
stern of the boat, rising leisurely from his recumbent position and
speaking with a courteous <i>savoir-faire</i> which seemed slightly
out of place in the wilds of Central Africa.&nbsp; He was a tall man
with a small aristocratic head and a refined face, which somehow suggested
an aristocrat of old France.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Durnovo.</p>
<p>The tall man stepped ashore and held out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad we have met you,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I have a
letter of introduction to you from Maurice Gordon, of Loango.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victor Durnovo&rsquo;s dark face changed slightly; his eyes&mdash;bilious,
fever-shot, unhealthy&mdash;took a new light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;are you a friend of Maurice
Gordon&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another question in this, an unasked one; and Victor Durnovo
was watching for the answer.&nbsp; But the face he watched was like
a delicately carved piece of brown marble, with a courteous, impenetrable
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met him again the other day at Loango.&nbsp; He is an old
Etonian like myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This conveyed nothing to Durnovo, who belonged to a different world,
whose education was, like other things about him, an unknown quantity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name,&rdquo; continued the tall man, &ldquo;is Meredith&mdash;John
Meredith&mdash;sometimes called Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were walking up the bank towards the dusky and uninviting tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the other fellow?&rdquo; inquired Durnovo, with a backward
jerk of the head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;he is my servant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Durnovo raised his eyebrows in somewhat contemptuous amusement, and
proceeded to open the letter which Meredith had handed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not many fellows,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;on this coast can
afford to keep a European servant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack Meredith bowed, and ignored the irony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he said courteously, &ldquo;I suppose you find
these coloured chaps just as good when they have once got into your
ways?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; muttered Durnovo.&nbsp; He was reading the
letter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Maurice Gordon,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;says
you are travelling for pleasure&mdash;just looking about you.&nbsp;
What do you think of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He indicated the dismal prospect with a harsh laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bit suggestive of Hell,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;eh?&nbsp;
How does it strike you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finer timber, I should think,&rdquo; suggested Jack Meredith,
and Durnovo laughed more pleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The truth is,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;that it strikes
one as a bit absurd that any man should travel up here for pleasure.&nbsp;
If you take my advice you will come down-stream again with me to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He evidently distrusted him; and the sidelong, furtive glance suggested
vaguely that Victor Durnovo had something farther up this river which
he wished to keep concealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; answered Meredith, with a half-suppressed
yawn, &ldquo;that the country gets finer farther up&mdash;more mountainous&mdash;less
suggestive of&mdash;Hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The proprietors of very dark eyes would do well to remember that
it is dangerous to glance furtively to one side or the other.&nbsp;
The attention of dark eyes is more easily felt than the glances of grey
or blue orbs.</p>
<p>Jack Meredith&rsquo;s suspicions were aroused by the suspicious manner
of his interlocutor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no white man knows this river as I do, and I do not
recommend it.&nbsp; Look at me&mdash;on the verge of jaundice&mdash;look
at this wound on my arm; it began with a scratch and has never healed.&nbsp;
All that comes from a month up this cursed river.&nbsp; Take my advice,
try somewhere else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly shall,&rdquo; replied Meredith.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
will discuss it after dinner.&nbsp; My chap is a first-rate cook.&nbsp;
Have you got anything to add to the <i>menu</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been living on plantains and
dried elephant-meat for the last fortnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t sound nourishing.&nbsp; Well, we are pretty
well provided, so perhaps you will give me the pleasure of your company
to dinner?&nbsp; Come as you are: no ceremony.&nbsp; I think I will
wash though.&nbsp; It is as well to keep up these old customs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a pleasant smile he went towards the tent which had just been
erected.&nbsp; Joseph was very busy, and his admonishing voice was heard
at times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Johnny, hammer in that peg.&nbsp; Now, old cups and
saucers, stop that grinning and fetch me some water.&nbsp; None of your
frogs and creepy crawly thing this time, my blonde beauty, but clean
water, comprenny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these and similar lightsome turns of speech was Joseph in the
habit of keeping his men up to the mark.&nbsp; The method was eminently
successful.&nbsp; His coloured compeers crowded round him &ldquo;all
of a grin,&rdquo; as he himself described it, and eager to do his slightest
behest.&nbsp; From the throne to the back-kitchen the secret of success
is the art of managing men&mdash;and women.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.&nbsp; THE SECRET OF THE SIMIACINE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surtout, Messieurs, pas de z&egrave;le.</i></p>
<p>Such was the meeting of Victor Durnovo and Jack Meredith.&nbsp; Two
men with absolutely nothing in common&mdash;no taste, no past, no kinship&mdash;nothing
but the future.&nbsp; Such men as Fate loves to bring together for her
own strange purposes.&nbsp; What these purposes are none of us can tell.&nbsp;
Some hold that Fate is wise.&nbsp; She is not so yet, but she cannot
fail to acquire wisdom some day, because she experiments so industriously.&nbsp;
She is ever bringing about new combinations, and one can only trust
that she, the experimenter, is as keenly disappointed in the result
as are we, the experimented.</p>
<p>To Jack Meredith Victor Durnovo conveyed the impression of little
surprise and a slight local interest.&nbsp; He was a man who was not
quite a gentleman; but for himself Jack did not give great heed to this.&nbsp;
He had associated with many such; for, as has been previously intimated,
he had moved in London society, where there are many men who are not
quite gentlemen.&nbsp; The difference of a good coat and that veiled
insolence which passes in some circles for the ease of good breeding
had no weight with the keen son of Sir John Meredith, and Victor Durnovo
fared no worse in his companion&rsquo;s estimation because he wore a
rough coat and gave small attention to his manners.&nbsp; He attracted
and held Jack&rsquo;s attention by a certain open-air manliness which
was in keeping with the situation and with his life.&nbsp; Sportsmen,
explorers and wanderers were not new to Jack; for nowadays one may never
know what manner of man is inside a faultless dress-suit.&nbsp; It is
an age of disappearing, via Charing Cross station in a first-class carriage,
to a life of backwooding, living from hand to mouth, starving in desert,
prairie, pampas or Arctic wild, with, all the while, a big balance at
Cox&rsquo;s.&nbsp; And most of us come back again and put on the dress-suit
and the white tie with a certain sense of restfulness and comfort.</p>
<p>Jack Meredith had known many such.&nbsp; He had, in a small way,
done the same himself.&nbsp; But he had never met one of the men who
do not go home&mdash;who possess no dress-coat and no use for it&mdash;whose
business it is to go about with a rifle in one hand and their life in
the other&mdash;who risk their lives because it is their trade and not
their pleasure.</p>
<p>Durnovo could not understand the new-comer at all.&nbsp; He saw at
once that this was one of those British aristocrats who do strange things
in a very strange way.&nbsp; In a degree Meredith reminded him of Maurice
Gordon, the man whose letter of introduction was at that moment serving
to light the camp fire.&nbsp; But it was Maurice Gordon without that
semi-sensual weakness of purpose which made him the boon companion of
Tom, Dick, or Harry, provided that one of those was only with him long
enough.&nbsp; There was a vast depth of reserve&mdash;of indefinable
possibilities, which puzzled Durnovo, and in some subtle way inspired
fear.</p>
<p>In that part of Africa which lies within touch of the Equator, life
is essentially a struggle.&nbsp; There is hunger about, and where hunger
is the emotions will be found also.&nbsp; Now Jack Meredith was a past-master
in the concealment of these, and, as such, came to Victor Durnovo in
the guise of a new creation.&nbsp; He had lived the latter and the larger
part of his life among men who said, in action if not in words, I am
hungry, or I am thirsty; I want this, or I want that; and if you are
not strong enough to keep it, I will take it from you.</p>
<p>This man was different; and Victor Durnovo did not know&mdash;could
not find out&mdash;<i>what</i> he wanted.</p>
<p>He had at first been inclined to laugh at him.&nbsp; What struck
him most forcibly was Joseph, the servant.&nbsp; The idea of a man swaggering
up an African river with a European man-servant was so preposterous
that it could only be met with ridicule; but the thing seemed so natural
to Jack Meredith, he accepted the servitude of Joseph so much as a matter
of course, that after a time Durnovo accepted him also as part and parcel
of Meredith.</p>
<p>Moreover, he immediately began to realise the benefit of being waited
upon by an intelligent European, for Joseph took off his coat, turned
up his sleeves, and proceeded to cook such a dinner as Durnovo had not
tasted for many months.&nbsp; There was wine also, and afterwards a
cigar of such quality as appealed strongly to Durnovo&rsquo;s West Indian
palate.</p>
<p>The night settled down over the land while they sat there, and before
them the great yellow equatorial moon rose slowly over the trees.&nbsp;
With the darkness came a greater silence, for the myriad insect life
was still.&nbsp; This great silence of Central Africa is wonderfully
characteristic.&nbsp; The country is made for silence, the natives are
created to steal, spirit-ridden, devil-haunted, through vast tracks
of lifeless forest, where nature is oppressive in her grandeur.&nbsp;
Here man is put into his right place&mdash;a puny, insignificant, helpless
being in a world that is too large for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; said Durnovo, returning to the subject which had
never really left his thoughts, &ldquo;you have come out here for pleasure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly.&nbsp; I came chiefly to make money, partly to
dispel some of the illusions of my youth, and I am getting on very well.&nbsp;
Picture-book illusions they were.&nbsp; The man who drew the pictures
had never seen Africa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is no country for illusions.&nbsp; Things go naked here&mdash;damned
naked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And only language is adorned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Durnovo laughed.&nbsp; He had to be alert to keep up with Jack Meredith&mdash;to
understand his speech; and he rather liked the necessity, which was
a change after the tropic indolence in which he had moved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swearing, you mean,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hope you
don&rsquo;t mind it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit.&nbsp; Do it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment Joseph, the servant, brought coffee served up in tin
cups.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First-class dinner,&rdquo; said Durnovo.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
best dinner I have had for years.&nbsp; Clever chap, your man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last remark was made as much for the servant&rsquo;s edification
as for the master&rsquo;s, and it was accompanied by an inviting smile
directed towards Joseph.&nbsp; Of this the man took no notice whatever.&nbsp;
He came from a world where masters and masters&rsquo; guests know their
place and keep it, even after a good dinner.</p>
<p>The evening had turned out so very differently from what he had expected
that Durnovo was a little off his balance.&nbsp; Things were so sociable
and pleasant in comparison with the habitual loneliness of his life.&nbsp;
The fire crackled so cheerily, the moon shone down on the river so grandly,
the subdued chatter of the boatmen imparted such a feeling of safety
and comfort to the scene, that he gave way to that impulse of expansiveness
which ever lurks in West Indian blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when you told me that you wanted
to make money, were you in earnest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the deadliest earnest,&rdquo; replied Jack Meredith, in
the half-mocking tone which he never wholly learnt to lay aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I think I can put you in the way of it.&nbsp; Oh, I know
it seems a bit premature&mdash;not known you long enough, and all that.&nbsp;
But in this country we don&rsquo;t hold much by the formalities.&nbsp;
I like you.&nbsp; I liked the look of you when you got out of that boat&mdash;so
damned cool and self-possessed.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re the right sort, Mr.
Meredith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly&mdash;for some things.&nbsp; For sitting about and
smoking first-class cigars and thinking second-class thoughts I am exactly
the right sort.&nbsp; But for making money, for hard work and steady
work, I am afraid, Mr. Durnovo, that I am distinctly the wrong sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re chaffing again.&nbsp; Do you always chaff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mostly; it lubricates things, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little pause.&nbsp; Durnovo looked round as if to make
sure that Joseph and the boatmen were out of earshot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you keep a secret?&rdquo; he asked suddenly.</p>
<p>Jack Meredith turned and looked at the questioner with a smile.&nbsp;
His hat had slipped to the back of his head, the light of the great
yellow moon fell full upon his clean-cut, sphinx-like face.&nbsp; The
eyes alone seemed living.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&nbsp; I can do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was only amused, and the words were spoken half-mockingly; but
his face said more than his lips.&nbsp; It said that even in chaff this
was no vain boast that he was uttering.&nbsp; Even before he had set
foot on African soil he had been asked to keep so many secrets of a
commercial nature.&nbsp; So many had begun by imparting half a secret,
to pass on in due course to the statement that only money was required,
say, a thousand pounds.&nbsp; And, in the meantime, twenty-five would
be very useful, and, if not that, well, ten shillings.&nbsp; Jack Meredith
had met all that before.</p>
<p>But there was something different about Durnovo.&nbsp; He was not
suitably got up.&nbsp; Your bar-room prospective millionaire is usually
a jolly fellow, quite prepared to quench any man&rsquo;s thirst for
liquor or information so long as credit and credulity will last.&nbsp;
There was nothing jolly or sanguine about Durnovo.&nbsp; Beneath his
broad-brimmed hat his dark eyes flashed in a fierce excitement.&nbsp;
His hand was unsteady.&nbsp; He had allowed the excellent cigar to go
out.&nbsp; The man was full of quinine and fever, in deadly earnest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see you&rsquo;re a gentleman,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
trust you.&nbsp; I want a man to join me in making a fortune.&nbsp;
I have got my hand on it at last.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m afraid of this
country.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m getting shaky; look at that hand.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
been looking for it too long.&nbsp; I take you into my confidence, the
first comer, you&rsquo;ll think.&nbsp; But there are not many men like
you in this country, and I&rsquo;m beastly afraid of dying.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
in a damned funk.&nbsp; I want to get out of this for a bit, but I dare
not leave until I set things going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take your time,&rdquo; said Meredith, quietly and soothingly;
&ldquo;light that cigar again and lie down.&nbsp; There is no hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Durnovo obeyed him meekly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;have you ever heard of Simiacine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot say that I have,&rdquo; replied Jack.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
is it for, brown boots or spasms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a drug, the most expensive drug in the market.&nbsp;
And they must have it, they cannot do without it, and they cannot find
a substitute.&nbsp; It is the leaf of a shrub, and your hatful is worth
a thousand pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is it to be found?&rdquo; asked Jack Meredith.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I should like some&mdash;in a sack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you may laugh now, but you won&rsquo;t when you hear all
about it.&nbsp; The scientific chaps called it Simiacine, because of
an old African legend which, like all those things, has a grain of truth
in it.&nbsp; The legend is, that the monkeys first found out the properties
of the leaf, and it is because they live on it that they are so strong.&nbsp;
Do you know that a gorilla&rsquo;s arm is not half so thick as yours,
and yet he would take you and snap your backbone across his knee; he
would bend a gun-barrel as you would bend a cane, merely by the turn
of his wrist.&nbsp; That is Simiacine.&nbsp; He can hang on to a tree
with one leg and tackle a leopard with his bare hands&mdash;that&rsquo;s
Simiacine.&nbsp; At home, in England and in Germany, they are only just
beginning to find out its properties; it seems that it can bring a man
back to life when he is more than half dead.&nbsp; There is no knowing
what children that are brought up on it may turn out to be; it may double
the power of the human brain&mdash;some think it will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack Meredith was leaning forward, watching with a certain sense
of fascination the wild, disease-stricken face, listening to the man&rsquo;s
breathless periods.&nbsp; It seemed that the fear of death, which had
gotten hold of him, gave Victor Durnovo no time to pause for breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Englishman, &ldquo;yes, go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is practically no limit to the demand that there is
for it.&nbsp; At present the only way of obtaining it is through the
natives, and you know their manner of trading.&nbsp; They send a little
packet down from the interior, and it very often takes two months and
more to reach the buyer&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; The money is sent back
the same way, and each man who fingers it keeps a little.&nbsp; The
natives find the leaf in the forests by the aid of trained monkeys,
and only in very small quantities.&nbsp; Do you follow me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I follow you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victor Durnovo leant forward until his face was within three inches
of Meredith, and the dark wild eyes flashed and glared into the Englishman&rsquo;s
steady glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; he hissed, &ldquo;what if I know where Simiacine
grows like a weed?&nbsp; What if I could supply the world with Simiacine
at my own price?&nbsp; Eh&mdash;h&mdash;h!&nbsp; What of that, Mr. Meredith?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He threw himself suddenly back and wiped his dripping face.&nbsp;
There was a silence, the great African silence that drives educated
men mad, and fills the imagination of the poor heathen with wild tales
of devils and spirits.</p>
<p>Then Jack Meredith spoke, without moving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m your man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;with a few more
details.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victor Durnovo was lying back at full length on the hard dry mud,
his arms beneath his head.&nbsp; Without altering his position he gave
the details, speaking slowly and much more quietly.&nbsp; It seemed
as if he spoke the result of long pent-up thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall want,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;two thousand pounds
to start it.&nbsp; For we must have an armed force of our own.&nbsp;
We have to penetrate through a cannibal country, of the fiercest devils
in Africa.&nbsp; It is a plateau, a little plateau of two square miles,
and the niggers think that it is haunted by an evil spirit.&nbsp; When
we get there we shall have to hold it by force of arms, and when we
send the stuff down to the coast we must have an escort of picked men.&nbsp;
The bushes grow up there as thick as gooseberry bushes in a garden at
home.&nbsp; With a little cultivation they will yield twice as much
as they do now.&nbsp; We shall want another partner.&nbsp; I know a
man, a soldierly fellow full of fight, who knows the natives and the
country.&nbsp; I will undertake to lead you there, but you will have
to take great care of me.&nbsp; You will have to have me carried most
of the way.&nbsp; I am weak, devilish weak, and I am afraid of dying;
but I know the way there, and no other man can say as much!&nbsp; It
is in my head here; it is not written down.&nbsp; It is only in my head,
and no one can get it out of there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Meredith, in his quiet, refined voice, &ldquo;no,
no one can get it out.&nbsp; Come, let us turn in.&nbsp; To-morrow I
will go down the river with you.&nbsp; I will turn back, and we can
talk it over as we go downstream.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.&nbsp; A RECRUIT</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Said the Engine from the East,<br /></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>They
who work best talk the least</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not, of course, for a poor limited masculine mind to utter
heresies regarding the great question of woman&rsquo;s rights.&nbsp;
But as things stand at present, as, in fact, the forenamed rights are
to-day situated, women have not found comprehension of the dual life.&nbsp;
The dual life is led solely by men, and until women have found out its
full compass and meaning, they can never lead in the world.&nbsp; There
is the public life and the private; and the men who are most successful
in the former are the most exclusive in the latter.&nbsp; Women have
only learned to lead one life; they must be all public or all private,
there is no medium.&nbsp; Those who give up the private life for which
Providence destined them, to assume the public existence to which their
own conceit urges them, have their own reward.&nbsp; They taste all
the bitterness of fame and never know its sweets, because the bitterness
is public and the sweets are private.</p>
<p>Women cannot understand that part of a man&rsquo;s life which brings
him into daily contact with men whom he does not bring home to dinner.&nbsp;
One woman does not know another without bringing her in to meals and
showing her her new hat.&nbsp; It is merely a matter of custom.&nbsp;
Men are in the habit of associating in daily, almost hourly, intercourse
with others who are never really their friends and are always held at
a distance.&nbsp; It is useless attempting to explain it, for we are
merely reprimanded for unfriendliness, stiffness, and stupid pride.&nbsp;
<i>Soit</i>!&nbsp; Let it go.&nbsp; Some of us, perhaps, know our own
business best.&nbsp; And there are, thank Heaven! amidst a multitude
of female doctors, female professors, female wranglers, a few female
women left.</p>
<p>Jack Meredith knew quite well what he was about when he listened
with a favourable ear to Durnovo&rsquo;s scheme.&nbsp; He knew that
this man was not a gentleman, but his own position was so assured that
he could afford to associate with any one.&nbsp; Here, again, men are
safer.&nbsp; A woman is too delicate a social flower to be independent
of environments.&nbsp; She takes the tone of her surroundings.&nbsp;
It is, one notices, only the ladies who protest that the barmaid married
in haste and repented of at leisure can raise herself to her husband&rsquo;s
level.&nbsp; The husband&rsquo;s friends keep silence, and perhaps,
like the mariner&rsquo;s bird, they meditate all the more.</p>
<p>What Meredith proposed to do was to enter into a partnership with
Victor Durnovo, and when the purpose of it was accomplished, to let
each man go his way.&nbsp; Such partnerships are entered into every
day.&nbsp; Men have carried through a brilliant campaign&mdash;a world-affecting
scheme&mdash;side by side, working with one mind and one heart; and
when the result has been attained they drop out of each other&rsquo;s
lives for ever.&nbsp; They are created so, for a very good purpose,
no doubt.&nbsp; But sometimes Providence steps in and turns the little
point of contact into the leaven that leaveneth the whole lump.&nbsp;
Providence, it seems&mdash;or let us call it Fate&mdash;was hovering
over that lone African river, where two men, sitting in the stern of
a native canoe, took it upon themselves to prearrange their lives.</p>
<p>A month later Victor Durnovo was in London.&nbsp; He left behind
him in Africa Jack Meredith, whose capacities for organisation were
developing very quickly.</p>
<p>There was plenty of work for each to do.&nbsp; In Africa Meredith
had undertaken to get together men and boats, while Durnovo went home
to Europe for a threefold purpose.&nbsp; Firstly, a visit to Europe
was absolutely necessary for his health, shattered as it was by too
long a sojourn in the fever-ridden river beds of the West Coast.&nbsp;
Secondly, there were rifles, ammunition, and stores to be purchased
and packed in suitable cases.&nbsp; And, lastly, he was to find and
enlist the third man, &ldquo;the soldierly fellow full of fight,&rdquo;
who knew the natives and the country.</p>
<p>This, indeed, was his first care on reaching London, and before his
eyes and brain were accustomed to the roar of the street life he took
a cab to Russell Square, giving the number affixed to the door of a
gloomy house in the least frequented corner of the stately quadrangle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Mr. Guy Oscard at home?&rdquo; he inquired of the grave
man-servant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is, sir,&rdquo; replied the butler, stepping aside.</p>
<p>Victor Durnovo thought that a momentary hesitation on the part of
the butler was caused by a very natural and proper feeling of admiration
for the new clothes and hat which he had purchased out of the money
advanced by Jack Meredith for the outfit of the expedition.&nbsp; In
reality the man was waiting for the visitor to throw away his cigar
before crossing the threshold.&nbsp; But he waited in vain, and Durnovo
stood, cigar in mouth, in the dining-room until Guy Oscard came to him.</p>
<p>At first Oscard did not recognise him, and conveyed this fact by
a distant bow and an expectant silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not seem to recognise me,&rdquo; said Durnovo with
a laugh, which lasted until the servant had closed the door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Victor
Durnovo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;yes&mdash;how are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oscard came forward and shook hands.&nbsp; His manner was not exactly
effusive.&nbsp; The truth was that their acquaintanceship in Africa
had been of the slightest, dating from some trivial services which Durnovo
had been able and very eager to render to the sportsman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right, thanks,&rdquo; replied Durnovo.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I only landed at Liverpool yesterday.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m home on
business.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m buying rifles and stores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy Oscard&rsquo;s honest face lighted up at once&mdash;the curse
of Ishmael was on him in its full force.&nbsp; He was destined to be
a wanderer on God&rsquo;s earth, and all things appertaining to the
wild life of the forests were music in his ears.</p>
<p>Durnovo was no mean diplomatist.&nbsp; He had learnt to know man,
within a white or coloured skin.&nbsp; The effect of his words was patent
to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember the Simiacine?&rdquo; he said abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil you have!&nbsp; Sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Durnovo took the chair indicated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve laid my hand on it at last.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve always been
on its track.&nbsp; That has been my little game all the time.&nbsp;
I did not tell you when we met out there, because I was afraid I should
never find it, and because I wanted to keep quiet about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy Oscard was looking out of the window across to the dull houses
and chimneys that formed his horizon, and in his eyes there was the
longing for a vaster horizon, a larger life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have got a partner,&rdquo; continued Durnovo, &ldquo;a good
man&mdash;Jack Meredith, son of Sir John Meredith.&nbsp; You have, perhaps,
met him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Oscard; &ldquo;but I have heard his name,
and I have met Sir John&mdash;the father&mdash;once or twice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is out there,&rdquo; went on Durnovo, &ldquo;getting things
together quietly.&nbsp; I have come home to buy rifles, ammunition,
and stores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, watching the eager, simple face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to know,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;if you will
organise and lead the fighting men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy Oscard drew a deep breath.&nbsp; There are some Englishmen left,
thank Heaven! who love fighting for its own sake, and not only for the
gain of it.&nbsp; Such men as this lived in the old days of chivalry,
at which modern puny carpet-knights make bold to laugh, while inwardly
thanking their stars that they live in the peaceful age of the policeman.&nbsp;
Such men as this ran their thick simple heads against many a windmill,
couched lance over many a far-fetched insult, and swung a sword in honour
of many a worthless maid; but they made England, my masters.&nbsp; Let
us remember that they made England.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there is to be fighting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Durnovo, &ldquo;there will be fighting.&nbsp;
We must fight our way there, and we must hold it when we get there.&nbsp;
But so far as the world is concerned, we are only a private expedition
exploring the source of the Ogowe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ogowe?&rdquo; and again Guy Oscard&rsquo;s eyes lighted
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do not mind telling you that much.&nbsp; To begin with,
I trust you; secondly, no one could get there without me to lead the
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy Oscard looked at him with some admiration, and that sympathy
which exists between the sons of Ishmael.&nbsp; Durnovo looked quite
fit for the task he set himself.&nbsp; He had regained his strength
on the voyage, and with returning muscular force his moral tone was
higher, his influence over men greater.&nbsp; Amidst the pallid sons
of the pavement among whom Guy Oscard had moved of late, this African
traveller was a man apart&mdash;a being much more after his own heart.&nbsp;
The brown of the man&rsquo;s face and hands appealed to him&mdash;the
dark flashing eyes, the energetic carriage of head and shoulders.&nbsp;
Among men of a fairer skin the taint that was in Victor Durnovo&rsquo;s
blood became more apparent&mdash;the shadow on his finger-nails, the
deep olive of his neck against the snowy collar, and the blue tint in
the white of his eyes.</p>
<p>But none of these things militated against him in Oscard&rsquo;s
mind.&nbsp; They only made him fitter for the work he had undertaken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long will it take?&rdquo; asked Guy.</p>
<p>Durnovo tugged at his strange, curtain-like moustache.&nbsp; His
mouth was hidden; it was quite impossible to divine his thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three months to get there,&rdquo; he answered at length.&nbsp;
&ldquo;One month to pick the leaf, and then you can bring the first
crop down to the coast and home, while Meredith and I stay on at the
plateau.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could be home again in eight months?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly!&nbsp; We thought that you might work the sale of
the stuff in London, and in a couple of years or so, when the thing
is in swing, Meredith will come home.&nbsp; We can safely leave the
cultivation in native hands when once we have established ourselves
up there, and made ourselves respected among the tribes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A significance in his tone made Guy Oscard look up inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know my way with the natives,&rdquo; answered Durnovo
with a cruel smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is the only way.&nbsp; There are
no laws in Central Africa except the laws of necessity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oscard was nothing if not outspoken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not like your way with the natives,&rdquo; he said, with
a pleasant smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is because you do not know them.&nbsp; But in this affair
you are to be the leader of the fighting column.&nbsp; You will, of
course, have <i>carte blanche</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oscard nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he said, after a pause, &ldquo;that there
is the question of money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; Meredith and I have talked that over.&nbsp; The plan
we fixed upon was that you and he each put a thousand pounds into it;
I put five hundred.&nbsp; For the first two years we share the profits
equally.&nbsp; After that we must come to some fresh arrangement, should
you or Meredith wish to give up an active part in the affair.&nbsp;
I presume you would not object to coming up at the end of a year, with
a handy squad of men to bring down the crop under escort?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Oscard, after a moment&rsquo;s reflection.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I should probably be able to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon,&rdquo; continued the other, &ldquo;that the journey
down could be accomplished in two months, and each time you do the trip
you will reduce your time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Durnovo went on, with the details which
he knew were music in Oscard&rsquo;s ears, &ldquo;of course we shall
be a clumsy party going up.&nbsp; We shall have heavy loads of provisions,
ammunition, and seeds for cultivating the land up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Guy Oscard absently.&nbsp; In his ears
there rang already the steady plash of the paddle, the weird melancholy
song of the boatmen, the music of the wind amidst the forest trees.</p>
<p>Durnovo rose briskly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you will join us?&nbsp; I may
telegraph out to Meredith that you will join us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Oscard simply.&nbsp; &ldquo;You may do
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no time to be lost,&rdquo; Durnovo went on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Every moment wasted adds to the risk of our being superseded.&nbsp;
I sail for Loango in a fortnight; will you come with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I take a passage for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Durnovo held out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shall I always find
you here when I want you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;stay, though!&nbsp; I shall be going away for a
few days.&nbsp; Come to-morrow to luncheon, and we will settle the preliminaries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right&mdash;one o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Durnovo had gone Guy sat down and wrote to Lady Cantourne accepting
her invitation to spend a few days at Cantourne Place, on the Solent.&nbsp;
He explained that his visit would be in the nature of a farewell, as
he was about to leave for Africa for a little big-game hunting.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.&nbsp; TO PASS THE TIME</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Quand on n&rsquo;a pas ce que l&rsquo;on
aime, il faut aimer ce que l&rsquo;on a.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Your energy, my dear lady, is not the least of many attributes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Cantourne looked up from her writing-desk with her brightest
smile.&nbsp; Sir John Meredith was standing by the open window, leaning
against the jamb thereof with a grace that had lost its youthful repose.&nbsp;
He was looking out, across a sloping lawn, over the Solent, and for
that purpose he had caused himself to be clad in a suit of blue serge.&nbsp;
He looked the veteran yachtsman to perfection&mdash;he could look anything
in its season&mdash;but he did his yachting from the shore&mdash;by
preference from the drawing-room window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One must keep up with the times, John,&rdquo; replied the
lady, daintily dipping her quill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And &lsquo;the times&rsquo; fills its house from roof to cellar
with people who behave as if they were in a hotel.&nbsp; Some of them&mdash;say
number five on the first floor, number eleven on the second, or some
of the atticated relatives&mdash;announce at breakfast that they will
not be home to lunch.&nbsp; Another says he cannot possibly return to
dinner at half-past seven, and so on.&nbsp; &lsquo;The times&rsquo;
expects a great deal for its money, and does not even allow one to keep
the small change of civility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Cantourne was blotting vigorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I admit,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;that the reaction is
rather strong; reactions are always stronger than they intend to be.&nbsp;
In our early days the formalities were made too much of; now they are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Made into a social hash,&rdquo; he suggested, when she paused
for a word, &ldquo;where the prevailing flavour is the common onion
of commerce!&nbsp; Now, I&rsquo;ll wager any sum that that is an invitation
to some one you do not care a screw about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is.&nbsp; But, Sir John, the hash must be kept moving;
cold hash is not palatable.&nbsp; I will tell you at once, I am inviting
young Semoor to fill the vacancy caused by Mr. Oscard&rsquo;s departure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Mr. Oscard proposes depriving us of his&mdash;society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He leaves to-morrow.&nbsp; He only came to say good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He moves on&mdash;to some other hostelry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&nbsp; He is going to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused, so that Sir John was forced to turn in courteous inquiry
and look her in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Africa!&rdquo; she added sharply, never taking her bright
eyes from his face.</p>
<p>She saw the twitching of the aged lips before his hand got there
to hide them.&nbsp; She saw his eyes fall before her steady gaze, and
she pitied him while she admired his uncompromising pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have reason to believe,&rdquo;
he added, turning to the window again, &ldquo;that there is a great
future before that country; all the intellect of Great Britain seems
to be converging in its direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since his departure Jack&rsquo;s name had never been mentioned, even
between these two whose friendship dated back a generation.&nbsp; Once
or twice Sir John had made a subtle passing reference to him, such as
perhaps no other woman but Lady Cantourne could have understood; but
Africa was, so to speak, blotted out of Sir John Meredith&rsquo;s map
of the world.&nbsp; It was there that he kept his skeleton&mdash;the
son who had been his greatest pride and his deepest humiliation&mdash;his
highest hope in life&mdash;almost the only failure of his career.</p>
<p>He stood there by the window, looking out with that well-bred interest
in details of sport and pastime which was part of his creed.&nbsp; He
braved it out even before the woman who had been a better friend to
him than his dead wife.&nbsp; Not even to her would he confess that
any event of existence could reach him through the impenetrable mask
he wore before the world.&nbsp; Not even she must know that aught in
his life could breathe of failure or disappointment.&nbsp; As it is
given to the best of women to want to take their sorrows to another,
so the strongest men instinctively deny their desire for sympathy.</p>
<p>Lady Cantourne, pretending to select another sheet of note-paper,
glanced at him with a pathetic little smile.&nbsp; Although they had
never been anything to each other, these two people had passed through
many of the trials to which humanity is heir almost side by side.&nbsp;
But neither had ever broken down.&nbsp; Each acted as a sort of mental
tonic on the other.&nbsp; They had tacitly agreed, years before, to
laugh at most things.&nbsp; She saw, more distinctly than any, the singular
emptiness of his clothes, as if the man was shrinking, and she knew
that the emptiness was of the heart.</p>
<p>Sir John Meredith had taught his son that Self and Self alone reigns
in the world.&nbsp; He had taught him that the thing called Love, with
a capital L, is nearly all Self, and that it finally dies in the arms
of Self.&nbsp; He had told him that a father&rsquo;s love, or a son&rsquo;s,
or a mother&rsquo;s, is merely a matter of convenience, and vanishes
when Self asserts itself.</p>
<p>Upon this principle they were both acting now, with a strikingly
suggestive similarity of method.&nbsp; Neither was willing to admit
to the world in general, and to the other in particular, that a cynical
theory could possibly be erroneous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry that our young friend is going to leave us,&rdquo;
said Sir John, taking up and unfolding the morning paper.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
is honest and candid, if he is nothing else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This meant that Guy Oscard&rsquo;s admiration for Millicent Chyne
had never been concealed for a moment, and Lady Cantourne knew it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He interests me,&rdquo; went on the old aristocrat, studying
the newspaper; and his hearer knew the inner significance of the remark.</p>
<p>At times she was secretly ashamed of her niece, but that <i>esprit
de corps</i> which binds women together prompted her always to defend
Millicent.&nbsp; The only defence at the moment was silence, and an
assumed density which did not deceive Sir John&mdash;even she could
not do that.</p>
<p>In the meantime Miss Millicent Chyne was walking on the sea-wall
at the end of the garden with Guy Oscard.&nbsp; One of the necessary
acquirements of a modern educational outfit is the power of looking
perfectly at home in a score of different costumes during the year,
and, needless to say, Miss Chyne was finished in this art.&nbsp; The
manner in which she wore her sailor-hat, her blue serge, and her neat
brown shoes conveyed to the onlooker, and especially the male of that
species (we cannot in conscience call them observers), the impression
that she was a yachtswoman born and bred.&nbsp; Her delicate complexion
was enhanced by the faintest suspicion of sunburn and a few exceedingly
becoming freckles.&nbsp; There was a freedom in her movements which
had not been observable in London drawing-rooms.&nbsp; This was Diana-like
and in perfect keeping with the dainty sailor outfit; moreover, nine
men out of ten would fail to attribute the difference to sundry cunning
strings within the London skirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is sad,&rdquo; Millicent was saying, &ldquo;to think that
we shall have no more chances of sailing.&nbsp; The wind has quite dropped,
that horrid tide is running, and&mdash;this is your last day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ended with a little laugh, knowing full well that there was little
sentiment in the big man by her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;I think I should be able
to manage a boat in time, don&rsquo;t you think so?&nbsp; Please encourage
me.&nbsp; I am sure I have tried to learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he remained persistently grave.&nbsp; She did not like that gravity;
she had met it before in the course of her experiments.&nbsp; One of
the grievances harboured by Miss Millicent Chyne against the opposite
sex was that they could not settle down into a harmless, honest flirtation.&nbsp;
Of course, this could be nothing but a flirtation of the lightest and
most evanescent description.&nbsp; She was engaged to Jack Meredith&mdash;poor
Jack, who was working for her, ever so hard, somewhere near the Equator&mdash;and
if Guy Oscard did not know this he had only himself to blame.&nbsp;
There were plenty of people ready to tell him.&nbsp; He had only to
ask.</p>
<p>Millicent Chyne, like Guy, was hampered at the outset of life by
theories upon it.&nbsp; Experience, the fashionable novel, and modern
cynicism had taught her to expect little from human nature&mdash;a dangerous
lesson, for it eases responsibility, and responsibility is the Ten Commandments
rolled into a compact whole, suitable for the pocket.</p>
<p>She expected of no man&mdash;not even of Jack&mdash;that perfect
faithfulness in every word and thought which is read of in books.&nbsp;
And it is one of the theories of the day that what one does not expect
one is not called upon to give.&nbsp; Jack, she reflected, was too much
a man of the world to expect her to sit and mope alone.&nbsp; She was
apparently incapable of seeing the difference between that pastime and
sitting on the sea-wall behind a large flowering currant-tree with a
man who did not pretend to hide the fact that he was in love with her.&nbsp;
Some women are thus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know if you have learnt much,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you learnt?&rdquo; she asked in a low voice, half-fascinated
by the danger into which she knew that she was running.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I love you,&rdquo; he answered, standing squarely in
front of her, and announcing the fact with a deliberate honesty which
was rather startling.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was not sure of it before, so I
stayed away from you for three weeks; but now I know for certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you mustn&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose hastily and turned away from him.&nbsp; There was in her
heart a sudden feeling of regret.&nbsp; It was the feeling that the
keenest sportsman sometimes has when some majestic monarch of the forest
falls before his merciless rifle&mdash;a sudden passing desire that
it might be undone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; He was desperately in earnest,
and that which made him a good sportsman&mdash;an unmatched big-game
hunter, calm and self-possessed in any strait&mdash;gave him a strange
deliberation now, which Millicent Chyne could not understand.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know&mdash;because you mustn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in her heart she wanted him to say it again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not ashamed of it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I do not
see why I should not say it to you&mdash;or to any one else, so far
as that goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, never!&rdquo; she cried, really frightened.&nbsp; &ldquo;To
me it does not matter so much.&nbsp; But to no one else&mdash;no, never!&nbsp;
Aunt Marian must not know it&mdash;nor Sir John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot see that it is any business of Sir John&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Of course, Lady Cantourne would have liked you to marry a title; but
if you cared for me she would be ready to listen to reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In which judgment of the good lady he was no doubt right&mdash;especially
if reason spoke with the voice of three thousand pounds per annum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you care for me?&rdquo; he asked, coming a little closer.</p>
<p>There was a whole world of gratified vanity and ungratified curiosity
for her in the presence of this strong man at her elbow.&nbsp; It was
one of the supreme triumphs of her life, because he was different from
the rest.&nbsp; He was for her what his first tiger had been for him.&nbsp;
The danger that he might come still nearer had for her a sense of keen
pleasure.&nbsp; She was thoroughly enjoying herself, and the nearest
approach that men can experience to the joy that was hers is the joy
of battle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot answer that&mdash;not now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the little half-shrinking glance over her shoulder was a low-minded,
unmaidenly invitation.&nbsp; But he was in earnest, and he was, above
all, a gentleman.&nbsp; He stood his ground a yard away from her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then when,&rdquo; he asked&mdash;&ldquo;when will you answer
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood with her back turned towards him, looking out over the
smooth waters of the Solent, where one or two yachts and a heavy black
schooner were creeping up on the tide before the morning breeze.&nbsp;
She drummed reflectively with her fingers on the low stone wall.&nbsp;
Beneath them a few gulls whirled and screamed over a shoal of little
fish.&nbsp; One of the birds had a singular cry, as if it were laughing
to itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said just now,&rdquo; Millicent answered at length, &ldquo;that
you were not sure yourself&mdash;not at first&mdash;and therefore you
cannot expect me to know all at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would know at once,&rdquo; he argued gravely, &ldquo;if
it was going to be no.&nbsp; If you do not say no now, I can only think
that it may be yes some day.&nbsp; And&rdquo;&mdash;he came closer&mdash;he
took the hand that hung at her side&mdash;conveniently near&mdash;&ldquo;and
I don&rsquo;t want you to say no now.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t say no!&nbsp;
I will wait as long as you like for yes.&nbsp; Millicent, I would rather
go on waiting, and thinking that it is going to be yes, even if it is
no after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said nothing, but she left her hand in his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I go on thinking that it will be yes until I come back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot prevent your thinking, can I?&rdquo; she whispered,
with a tender look in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And may I write to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&nbsp; Now and then,&rdquo; he
pleaded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not often.&nbsp; Just to remind you of my existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave a little laugh, which he liked exceedingly, and remembered
afterwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you like,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>At this moment Lady Cantourne&rsquo;s voice was heard in the distance,
calling them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; exclaimed Millicent.&nbsp; &ldquo;We must go
at once.&nbsp; And no one&mdash;no one, mind&mdash;must know of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one shall know of it,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER X.&nbsp; LOANGO</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Faithful and hopeful, wise in charity,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong
in grave peace, in pity circumspect.</i></p>
<p>Those who for their sins have been to Loango will scarcely care to
have its beauties recalled to memory.&nbsp; And to such as have not
yet visited the spot one can only earnestly recommend a careful avoidance.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, therefore, that there is such a place, and the
curious may find it marked in larger type than it deserves on the map
of Africa, on the West Coast of that country, and within an inch or
so of the Equator.</p>
<p>Loango has a bar, and outside of that mysterious and somewhat suggestive
nautical hindrance the coasting steamers anchor, while the smaller local
fry find harbour nearer to the land.&nbsp; The passenger is not recommended
to go ashore&mdash;indeed, many difficulties are placed in his way,
and he usually stays on board while the steamer receives or discharges
a scanty cargo, rolling ceaselessly in the Atlantic swell.&nbsp; The
roar of the surf may be heard, and at times some weird cry or song.&nbsp;
There is nothing to tempt even the most adventurous through that surf.&nbsp;
A moderately large white building attracts the eye, and usually brings
upon itself a contemptuous stare, for it seems to be the town of Loango,
marked so bravely on the map.&nbsp; As a matter of fact the town is
five miles inland, and the white building is only a factory or trading
establishment.</p>
<p>Loango is the reverse of cheerful.&nbsp; To begin with, it is usually
raining there.&nbsp; The roar of the surf&mdash;than which there are
few sadder sounds on earth&mdash;fills the atmosphere with a never-ceasing
melancholy.&nbsp; The country is overwooded; the tropical vegetation,
the huge tangled African trees, stand almost in the surf; and inland
the red serrated hills mount guard in gloomy array.&nbsp; For Europeans
this country is accursed.&nbsp; From the mysterious forest-land there
creeps down a subtle, tainted air that poisons the white man&rsquo;s
blood, and either strikes him down in a fever or terrifies him by strange
unknown symptoms and sudden disfiguring disease.&nbsp; The Almighty
speaks very plainly sometimes and in some places&mdash;nowhere more
plainly than on the West Coast of Africa, which land He evidently wants
for the black man.&nbsp; We of the fairer skin have Australia now; we
are taking America, we are dominant in Asia; but somehow we don&rsquo;t
get on in Africa.&nbsp; The Umpire is there, and He insists on fair
play.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not cheery,&rdquo; Jack Meredith observed to his servant
as they found themselves deposited on the beach within a stone&rsquo;s-throw
of the French factory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, not cheery, sir,&rdquo; replied Joseph.&nbsp; He
was very busy attending to the landing of their personal effects, and
had only time to be respectful.&nbsp; It was Joseph&rsquo;s way to do
only one thing at a time, on the principle, no doubt, that enough for
the moment is the evil thereof.&nbsp; His manner implied that, when
those coloured gentlemen had got the baggage safely conveyed out of
the boats on to the beach, it would be time enough to think about Loango.</p>
<p>Moreover, Joseph was in his way rather a dauntless person.&nbsp;
He held that there were few difficulties which he and his master, each
in his respective capacity, were unable to meet.&nbsp; This African
mode of life was certainly not one for which he had bargained when taking
service; but he rather enjoyed it than otherwise, and he was consoled
by the reflection that what was good enough for his master was good
enough for him.&nbsp; Beneath the impenetrable mask of a dignified servitude
he knew that this was &ldquo;all along of that Chyne girl,&rdquo; and
rightly conjectured that it would not last for ever.&nbsp; He had an
immense respect for Sir John, whom he tersely described as a &ldquo;game
one,&rdquo; but his knowledge of the world went towards the supposition
that headstrong age would finally bow before headstrong youth.&nbsp;
He did not, however, devote much consideration to these matters, being
a young man although an old soldier, and taking a lively interest in
the present.</p>
<p>It had been arranged by letter that Jack Meredith should put up,
as his host expressed it, at the small bungalow occupied by Maurice
Gordon and his sister.&nbsp; Gordon was the local head of a large trading
association somewhat after the style of the old East India Company,
and his duties partook more of the glory of a governor than of the routine
of a trader.</p>
<p>Of Maurice Gordon&rsquo;s past Meredith knew nothing beyond the fact
that they were schoolfellows strangely brought together again on the
deck of a coasting steamer.&nbsp; Maurice Gordon was not a reserved
person, and it was rather from a lack of opportunity than from an excess
of caution that he allowed his new-found friend to go up the Ogowe river,
knowing so little of himself, Maurice Gordon, of Loango.</p>
<p>There were plenty of willing guides and porters on the beach; for
in this part of Africa there is no such thing as continued and methodical
labour.&nbsp; The entire population considers the lilies of the field
to obvious purpose.</p>
<p>Joseph presently organised a considerable portion of this population
into a procession, headed triumphantly by an old white-woolled negro
whose son cleaned Maurice Gordon&rsquo;s boots.&nbsp; This man Joseph
selected&mdash;not without one or two jokes of a somewhat personal nature&mdash;as
a fitting guide to the Gordons&rsquo; house.&nbsp; As they neared the
little settlement on the outskirts of the black town where the mission
and other European residences are situated, the veteran guide sent on
couriers to announce the arrival of the great gentleman, who had for
body-servant the father of laughter.</p>
<p>On finally reaching the bungalow Meredith was pleasantly surprised.&nbsp;
It was pretty and homelike&mdash;surrounded by a garden wherein grew
a strange profusion of homely English vegetables and tropical flowers.</p>
<p>Joseph happened to be in front, and, as he neared the verandah, he
suddenly stopped at the salute; moreover, he began to wonder in which
trunk he had packed his master&rsquo;s dress-clothes.</p>
<p>An English lady was coming out of the drawing-room window to meet
the travellers&mdash;a lady whose presence diffused that sense of refinement
and peace into the atmosphere which has done as much towards the expansion
of our piecemeal empire as ever did the strong right arm of Thomas Atkins.&nbsp;
It is because&mdash;sooner or later&mdash;these ladies come with us
that we have learnt to mingle peace with war&mdash;to make friends of
whilom enemies.</p>
<p>She nodded in answer to the servant&rsquo;s salutation, and passed
on to greet the master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother has been called away suddenly,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;One of his sub-agents has been getting into trouble with the
natives.&nbsp; Of course you are Mr. Meredith?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; replied Jack, taking the hand she held out; it
was a small white hand&mdash;small without being frail or diaphanous.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And you are Miss Gordon, I suppose?&nbsp; I am sorry Gordon is
away, but no doubt we shall be able to find somewhere to put up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not do that,&rdquo; she said quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;This
is Africa, you know.&nbsp; You can quite well stay with us, although
Maurice is away until to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite!&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>She was tall and fair, with a certain stateliness of carriage which
harmonised wonderfully with a thoughtful and pale face.&nbsp; She was
not exactly pretty, but gracious and womanly, with honest blue eyes
that looked on men and women alike.&nbsp; She was probably twenty-eight
years of age; her manner was that of a woman rather than of a girl&mdash;of
one who was in life and not on the outskirts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We rather pride ourselves,&rdquo; she said, leading the way
into the drawing-room, &ldquo;upon having the best house in Loango.&nbsp;
You will, I think, be more comfortable here than anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned and looked at him with a slow, grave smile.&nbsp; She
was noticing that, of the men who had been in this drawing-room, none
had seemed so entirely at his ease as this one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must ask you to believe that I was thinking of your comfort
and not of my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know you were,&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our
circle is rather limited, as you will find, and very few of the neighbours
have time to think of their houses.&nbsp; Most of them are missionaries,
and they are so busy; they have a large field, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very&mdash;and a weedy one, I should think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was looking round, noting with well-trained glance the thousand
little indescribable touches that make a charming room.&nbsp; He knew
his ground.&nbsp; He knew the date and the meaning of every little ornament&mdash;the
title and the writer of each book&mdash;the very material with which
the chairs were covered; and he knew that all was good&mdash;all arranged
with that art which is the difference between ignorance and knowledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you have all the new books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we have books and magazines; but, of course, we live
quite out of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused, leaving the conversation with him, as in the hands of
one who knew his business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; he said, filling up the pause, &ldquo;have hitherto
lived in the world&mdash;right in it.&nbsp; There is a lot of dust and
commotion; the dust gets into people&rsquo;s eyes and blinds them; the
commotion wears them out; and perhaps, after all, Loango is better!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke with the easy independence of the man of the world, accustomed
to feel his way in strange places&mdash;not heeding what opinion he
might raise&mdash;what criticism he might brave.&nbsp; He was glancing
round him all the while, noting things, and wondering for whose benefit
this pretty room had been evolved in the heart of a savage country.&nbsp;
Perhaps he had assimilated erroneous notions of womankind in the world
of which he spoke; perhaps he had never met any of those women whose
natural refinement urges them to surround themselves, even in solitude,
with pretty things, and prompts them to dress as neatly and becomingly
as their circumstances allow for the edification of no man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never abuse Loango,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;such abuse
is apt to recoil.&nbsp; To call a place dull is often a confession of
dulness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed&mdash;still in that somewhat unnatural manner, as if desirous
of filling up time.&nbsp; He had spent the latter years of his life
in doing nothing else.&nbsp; The man&rsquo;s method was so different
to what Jocelyn Gordon had met with in Loango, where men were all in
deadly earnest, pursuing souls or wealth, that it struck her forcibly,
and she remembered it long after Meredith had forgotten its use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no idea,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;how the place
strikes the passing traveller; he usually passes by on the other side;
but I am afraid there is nothing to arouse the smallest interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Miss Gordon, I am not the passing traveller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up with a sudden interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&nbsp; I understood from Maurice that you were travelling
down the coast without any particular object.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have an object&mdash;estimable, if not quite original.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to make some money.&nbsp; I have never made any yet,
so there is a certain novelty in the thought which is pleasant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled with the faintest suspicion of incredulity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you are thinking,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;that
I am too neat and tidy&mdash;too namby-pamby to do anything in this
country.&nbsp; That my boots are too narrow in the toe, my hair too
short and my face too clean.&nbsp; I cannot help it.&nbsp; It is the
fault of the individual you saw outside&mdash;Joseph.&nbsp; He insists
on a strict observance of the social duties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are rougher here,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left England,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;in rather a hurry.&nbsp;
I had no time to buy uncomfortable boots, or anything like that.&nbsp;
I know it was wrong.&nbsp; The ordinary young man of society who goes
morally to the dogs and physically to the colonies always has an outfit.&nbsp;
His friends buy him an outfit, and certain enterprising haberdashers
make a study of such things.&nbsp; I came as I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was speaking she had been watching him&mdash;studying him
more closely than she had hitherto been able to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard of a Sir John Meredith,&rdquo; she said suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, drawing in his legs, and apparently studying the neat
brown boots of which there had been question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should you meet him again,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;it would
not be advisable to mention my name.&nbsp; He might not care to hear
it.&nbsp; We have had a slight difference of opinion.&nbsp; With me
it is different.&nbsp; I am always glad to hear about him.&nbsp; I have
an immense respect for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She listened gravely, with a sympathy that did not attempt to express
itself in words.&nbsp; On such a short acquaintance she had not learnt
to expect a certain lightness of conversational touch which he always
assumed when speaking of himself, as if his own thoughts and feelings
were matters for ridicule.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I was in the wrong.&nbsp;
I know that.&nbsp; But it sometimes happens that a man is not in a position
to admit that he is in the wrong&mdash;when, for instance, another person
would suffer by such an admission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Jocelyn; &ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment a servant came in with lamps and proceeded to close
the windows.&nbsp; She was quite an old woman&mdash;an Englishwoman&mdash;and
as she placed the lamps upon the table she scrutinised the guest after
the manner of a privileged servitor.&nbsp; When she had departed Jack
Meredith continued his narrative with a sort of deliberation which was
explained later on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that is why I came to Africa&mdash;that
is why I want to make money.&nbsp; I do not mind confessing to a low
greed of gain, because I think I have the best motive that a man can
have for wanting to make money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said this meaningly, and watched her face all the while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A motive which any lady ought to approve of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I approve and I admire your spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose as she spoke, and moved towards a side table, where two
lighted candles had been placed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My motive for talking so barefacedly about myself,&rdquo;
he said, as they moved towards the door together, &ldquo;was to let
you know exactly who I am and why I am here.&nbsp; It was only due to
you on accepting your hospitality.&nbsp; I might have been a criminal
or an escaped embezzler.&nbsp; There were two on board the steamer coming
out, and several other shady characters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the girl; &ldquo;I saw your motive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were now in the hall, and the aged servant was waiting to show
him his room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.&nbsp; A COMPACT</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Drifting, slow drifting down a wizard
stream.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;No one knows,&rdquo; Victor Durnovo was in the habit of saying,
&ldquo;what is going on in the middle of Africa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And on this principle he acted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten miles above the camping-ground where we first met,&rdquo;
he had told Meredith, &ldquo;you will find a village where I have my
headquarters.&nbsp; There is quite a respectable house there, with&mdash;a&mdash;a
woman to look after your wants.&nbsp; When you have fixed things up
at Loango, and have arranged for the dhows to meet my steamer, take
up all your men to this village&mdash;Msala is the name&mdash;and send
the boats back.&nbsp; Wait there till we come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In due time the telegram came, <i>vi&acirc;</i> St. Paul de Loanda,
announcing the fact that Oscard had agreed to join the expedition, and
that Durnovo and he might be expected at Msala in one month from that
time.&nbsp; It was not without a vague feeling of regret that Jack Meredith
read this telegram.&nbsp; To be at Msala in a month with forty men and
a vast load of provisions meant leaving Loango almost at once.&nbsp;
And, strange though it may seem, he had become somewhat attached to
the dreary West African town.&nbsp; The singular cosmopolitan society
was entirely new to him; the life, taken as a life, almost unique.&nbsp;
He knew that he had not outstayed his welcome.&nbsp; Maurice Gordon
had taken care to assure him of that in his boisterous, hearty manner,
savouring more of Harrow than of Eton, every morning at breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound Durnovo!&rdquo; he cried, when the telegram had been
read aloud.&nbsp; &ldquo;Confound him, with his energy and his business-like
habits!&nbsp; That means that you will have to leave us before long;
and somehow it has got to be quite natural to see you come lounging
in ten minutes late for most things, with an apology for Jocelyn, but
none for me.&nbsp; We shall miss you, old chap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Jocelyn, &ldquo;we shall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was busy with the cups, and spoke rather indifferently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve got Oscard?&rdquo; continued Maurice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I imagine he is a good man&mdash;tip-top shot and all that.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve never met him, but I have heard of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a gentleman, at all events,&rdquo; said Meredith quietly;
&ldquo;I know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jocelyn was looking at him between the hibiscus flowers decorating
the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Mr. Durnovo going to be leader of the expedition?&rdquo;
she inquired casually, after a few moments&rsquo; silence; and Jack,
looking up with a queer smile, met her glance for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>Maurice Gordon&rsquo;s hearty laugh interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wonder where the dickens
you men are going to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up the Ogowe river,&rdquo; replied Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt.&nbsp; But what for?&nbsp; There is something mysterious
about that river.&nbsp; Durnovo keeps his poor relations there, or something
of that kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not going to look for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Maurice, helping himself to marmalade,
&ldquo;that he has dropped upon some large deposit of ivory; that will
turn out to be the solution of the mystery.&nbsp; It is the solution
of most mysteries in this country.&nbsp; I wish I could solve the mysteries
of ways and means and drop upon a large deposit of ivory, or spice,
or precious stones.&nbsp; We should soon be out of this country, should
we not, old girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think we have much to complain of,&rdquo; answered
Jocelyn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; you never do.&nbsp; Moreover, I do not suppose you would
do so if you had the excuse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I should, if I thought it would do any good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; put in Meredith.&nbsp; &ldquo;There speaks Philosophy&mdash;jam,
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or Resignation&mdash;that is strawberry and this is black
currant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, black currant.&nbsp; No&mdash;Philosophy.&nbsp; Resignation
is the most loathsome of the virtues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I care for any of them very much,&rdquo;
put in Maurice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I thought you seemed to shun them,&rdquo; said Jack, like
a flash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sharp! very sharp!&nbsp; Jocelyn, do you know what we called
him at school?&mdash;the French nail; he was so very long and thin and
sharp!&nbsp; I might add polished and strong, but we were not so polite
in those days.&nbsp; Poor old Jack! he gave as good as he got.&nbsp;
But I must be off&mdash;the commerce of Western Africa awaits me.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll be round at the office presently, I suppose, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I have an appointment there with a coloured person who
is a liar by nature and a cook by trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maurice Gordon usually went off like this&mdash;at a moment&rsquo;s
notice.&nbsp; He was one of those loud-speaking, quick-actioned men,
who often get a reputation for energy and capacity without fully deserving
it.</p>
<p>Jack, of a more meditative habit, rarely followed his host with the
same obvious haste.&nbsp; He finished his breakfast calmly, and then
asked Jocelyn whether she was coming out on to the verandah.&nbsp; It
was a habit they had unconsciously dropped into.&nbsp; The verandah
was a very important feature of the house, thickly overhung as it was
with palms, bananas, and other tropical verdure.&nbsp; Africa is the
land of creepers, and all around this verandah, over the trellis-work,
around the supports, hanging in festoons from the roof, were a thousand
different creeping flowers.&nbsp; The legend of the house&mdash;for,
as in India, almost every bungalow on the West Coast has its tale&mdash;was
that one of the early missionaries had built it, and, to beguile the
long months of the rainy season, had carefully collected these creepers
to beautify the place against the arrival of his young wife.&nbsp; She
never came.&nbsp; A telegram stopped her.&nbsp; A snake interrupted
his labour of love.</p>
<p>Jack took a seat at once, and began to search for his cigar-case
in the pocket of his jacket.&nbsp; In this land of flies and moths men
need not ask permission before they smoke.&nbsp; Jocelyn did not sit
down at once.&nbsp; She went to the front of the verandah and watched
her brother mount his horse.&nbsp; She was a year older than Maurice
Gordon, and exercised a larger influence over his life than either of
them suspected.</p>
<p>Presently he rode past the verandah, waving his hand cheerily.&nbsp;
He was one of those large, hearty Englishmen who seem to be all appetite
and laughter&mdash;men who may be said to be manly, and beyond that
nothing.&nbsp; Their manliness is so overpowering that it swallows up
many other qualities which are not out of place in men, such as tact
and thoughtfulness, and <i>perhaps</i> intellectuality and the power
to take some interest in those gentler things that interest women.</p>
<p>When Jocelyn came to the back of the verandah she was thinking about
her brother Maurice, and it never suggested itself to her that she should
not speak her thoughts to Meredith, whom she had not seen until three
weeks ago.&nbsp; She had never spoken of Maurice behind his back to
any man before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it ever strike you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that Maurice
is the sort of man to be led astray by evil influence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; or to be led straight by a good influence, such as yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not meet her thoughtful gaze.&nbsp; He was apparently watching
the retreating form of the horse through the tangle of flower and leaf
and tendril.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;that my influence
is not of much account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really believe that?&rdquo; asked Meredith, turning
upon her with a half-cynical smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered simply.</p>
<p>Before speaking again he took a pull at his cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your influence,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;appears to me to be
the making of Maurice Gordon.&nbsp; I frequently see serious flaws in
the policy of Providence; but I suppose there is wisdom in making the
strongest influence that which is unconscious of its power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you think I have some power over him,&rdquo; said
Jocelyn; &ldquo;but, at the same time, it makes me uneasy, because it
only confirms my conviction that he is very easily led.&nbsp; And suppose
my influence&mdash;such as it is&mdash;was withdrawn?&nbsp; Suppose
that I were to die, or, what appears to be more likely, suppose that
he should marry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let us hope that he will marry the right person.&nbsp;
People sometimes do, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled with a strange little flicker of the eyelids.&nbsp; They
had grown wonderfully accustomed to each other during the last three
weeks.&nbsp; Here, it would appear, was one of those friendships between
man and woman that occasionally set the world agog with curiosity and
scepticism.&nbsp; But there seemed to be no doubt about it.&nbsp; He
was over thirty, she verging on that prosaic age.&nbsp; Both had lived
and moved in the world; to both life was an open book, and they had
probably discovered, as most of us do, that the larger number of the
leaves are blank.&nbsp; He had almost told her that he was engaged to
be married, and she had quite understood.&nbsp; There could not possibly
be any misapprehension; there was no room for one of those little mistakes
about which people write novels and fondly hope that some youthful reader
may be carried away by a very faint resemblance to that which they hold
to be life.&nbsp; Moreover, at thirty, one leaves the first romance
of youth behind.</p>
<p>There was something in her smile that suggested that she did not
quite believe in his cynicism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also,&rdquo; she said gravely, &ldquo;some stronger influence
might appear&mdash;an influence which I could not counteract.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack Meredith turned in his long chair and looked at her searchingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a vague idea,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you are thinking
of Durnovo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; she admitted, with some surprise.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
wonder how you knew?&nbsp; I am afraid of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can reassure you on that score,&rdquo; said Meredith.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For the next two years or so Durnovo will be in daily intercourse
with me.&nbsp; He will be under my immediate eye.&nbsp; I did not anticipate
much pleasure from his society.&nbsp; But now I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked, rather mystified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I shall have the daily satisfaction of knowing that
I am relieving you of an anxiety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very kind of you to put it in that way,&rdquo; said
Jocelyn.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I should not like you to sacrifice yourself
to what may be a foolish prejudice on my part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not a foolish prejudice.&nbsp; Durnovo is not a gentleman
either by birth or inclination.&nbsp; He is not fit to associate with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this Jocelyn answered nothing.&nbsp; Victor Durnovo was one of
her brother&rsquo;s closest friends&mdash;a friend of his own choosing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Gordon,&rdquo; said Jack Meredith suddenly, with a gravity
that was rare, &ldquo;will you do me a favour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I should like to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You admit that you are afraid of Durnovo now: if at any time
you have reason to be more afraid, will you make use of me?&nbsp; Will
you write or come to me and ask my help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said hesitatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he went on, in a lighter tone, &ldquo;I am
not afraid of Durnovo.&nbsp; I have met Durnovos before.&nbsp; You may
have observed that my locks no longer resemble the raven&rsquo;s wing.&nbsp;
There is a little grey&mdash;just here&mdash;above the temple.&nbsp;
I am getting on in life, and I know how to deal with Durnovos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the girl, with a little sigh of relief.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The feeling that I have some one to turn to will be a great relief.&nbsp;
You see how I am placed here.&nbsp; The missionaries are very kind and
well-meaning, but there are some things which they do not quite understand.&nbsp;
They may be gentlemen&mdash;some of them are; but they are not men of
the world.&nbsp; I have no definite thought or fear, and very good persons,
one finds, are occasionally a little dense.&nbsp; Unless things are
very definite, they do not understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the other hand,&rdquo; pursued Jack, in the same reflective
tone, as if taking up her thought, &ldquo;persons who are not good have
a perception of the indefinite.&nbsp; I did not think of it in that
light before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jocelyn Gordon laughed softly, without attempting to meet his lighter
vein.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she said, after a little silence, &ldquo;that
I was actually thinking of warning you against Mr. Durnovo?&nbsp; Now
I stand aghast at my own presumption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was kind of you to give the matter any thought whatever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose and threw away the end of his cigar.&nbsp; Joseph was already
before the door, leading the horse which Maurice Gordon had placed at
his visitor&rsquo;s disposal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will lay the warning to heart,&rdquo; he said, standing
in front of Jocelyn and looking down at her as she lay back in the deep
basket-chair.&nbsp; She was simply dressed in white&mdash;as was her
wont, for it must be remembered that they were beneath the Equator&mdash;a
fair English maiden, whose thoughts were hidden behind a certain gracious,
impenetrable reserve.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will lay it to heart, although
you have not uttered it.&nbsp; But I have always known with what sort
of man I was dealing.&nbsp; We serve each other&rsquo;s purpose, that
is all; and he knows that as well as I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad Mr. Oscard is going with you,&rdquo; she answered
guardedly.</p>
<p>He waited a moment.&nbsp; It seemed as if she had not done speaking&mdash;as
if there was another thought near the surface.&nbsp; But she did not
give voice to it, and he turned away.&nbsp; The sound of the horse&rsquo;s
feet on the gravel did not arouse her from the reverie into which she
had fallen; and long after it had died away, leaving only the hum of
insect life and the distant ceaseless song of the surf, Jocelyn Gordon
sat apparently watching the dancing shadows on the floor as the creepers
waved in the breeze.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.&nbsp; A MEETING</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>No one can be more wise than destiny.</i></p>
<p>The short equatorial twilight was drawing to an end, and all Nature
stood in silence, while Night crept up to claim the land where her reign
is more autocratic than elsewhere on earth.&nbsp; There is a black night
above the trees, and a blacker beneath.&nbsp; In an hour it would be
dark, and, in the meantime, the lowering clouds were tinged with a pink
glow that filtered through from above.&nbsp; There was rain coming,
and probably thunder.&nbsp; Moreover, the trees seemed to know it, for
there was a limpness in their attitude as if they were tucking their
heads into their shoulders in anticipation of the worst.&nbsp; The insects
were certainly possessed of a premonition.&nbsp; They had crept away.</p>
<p>It was distinctly an unlikely evening for the sportsman.&nbsp; The
stillness was so complete that the faintest rustle could be heard at
a great distance.&nbsp; Moreover, it was the sort of evening when Nature
herself seems to be glancing over her shoulder with timorous restlessness.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a sportsman was abroad.&nbsp; He was creeping up the
right-hand bank of a stream, his only chance lying in the noise of the
waters, which might serve to deaden the sound of broken twig or rustling
leaf.</p>
<p>This sportsman was Jack Meredith, and it was evident that he was
bringing to bear upon the matter in hand that intelligence and keenness
of perception which had made him a person of some prominence in other
scenes where Nature has a less assured place.</p>
<p>It would appear that he was not so much at home in the tangle of
an African forest as in the crooked paths of London society; for his
clothes were torn in more than one place; a mosquito, done to sudden
death, adhered sanguinarily to the side of his aristocratic nose, while
heat and mental distress had drawn damp stripes down his countenance.&nbsp;
His hands were scratched and inclined to bleed, and one leg had apparently
been in a morass.&nbsp; Added to these physical drawbacks there was
no visible sign of success, which was probably the worst part of Jack
Meredith&rsquo;s plight.</p>
<p>Since sunset he had been crawling, scrambling, stumbling up the bank
of this stream in relentless pursuit of some large animal which persistently
kept hidden in the tangle across the bed of the river.&nbsp; The strange
part of it was that when he stopped to peep through the branches the
animal stopped too, and he found no way of discovering its whereabouts.&nbsp;
More than once they remained thus for nearly five minutes, peering at
each other through the heavy leafage.&nbsp; It was distinctly unpleasant,
for Meredith felt that the animal was not afraid of him, and did not
fully understand the situation.&nbsp; The respective positions of hunter
and hunted were imperfectly defined.&nbsp; He had hitherto confined
his attentions to such game as showed a sporting readiness to run away,
and there was a striking novelty in this unseen beast of the forest,
fresh, as it were, from the hands of its Creator, that entered into
the fun of the thing from a totally mistaken standpoint.</p>
<p>Once Meredith was able to decide approximately the whereabouts of
his prey by the momentary shaking of a twig.&nbsp; He raised his rifle
and covered that twig steadily; his forefinger played tentatively on
the trigger; but on second thoughts he refrained.&nbsp; He was keenly
conscious of the fact that the beast was doing its work with skill superior
to his own.&nbsp; In comparison to his, its movements were almost noiseless.&nbsp;
Jack Meredith was too clever a man to be conceited in the wrong place,
which is the habit of fools.&nbsp; He recognised very plainly that he
was not distinguishing himself in this new field of glory; he was not
yet an accomplished big-game hunter.</p>
<p>Twice he raised his rifle with the intention of firing at random
into the underwood on the remote chance of bringing his enemy into the
open.&nbsp; But the fascination of this duel of cunning was too strong,
and he crept onwards with bated breath.</p>
<p>It was terrifically hot, and all the while Night was stalking westward
on the summits of the trees with stealthy tread.</p>
<p>While absorbed in the intricacies of pursuit&mdash;while anathematising
tendrils and condemning thorns to summary judgment&mdash;Jack Meredith
was not losing sight of his chance of getting back to the little village
of Msala.&nbsp; He knew that he had only to follow the course of the
stream downwards, retracing his steps until a junction with the Ogowe
river was effected.&nbsp; In the meantime his lips were parted breathlessly,
and there was a light in the quiet eyes which might have startled some
of his well-bred friends could they have seen it.</p>
<p>At last he came to an open space made by a slip of the land into
the bed of the river.&nbsp; When Jack Meredith came to this he stepped
out of the thicket and stood in the open, awaiting the approach of his
stealthy prey.&nbsp; The sound of its footfall was just perceptible,
slowly diminishing the distance that divided them.&nbsp; Then the trees
were parted, and a tall, fair man stepped forward on to the opposite
bank.</p>
<p>Jack Meredith bowed gravely, and the other sportsman, seeing the
absurdity of the situation, burst into hearty laughter.&nbsp; In a moment
or two he had leapt from rock to rock and come to Meredith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that we have been wasting
a considerable amount of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I very nearly wasted powder and shot,&rdquo; replied Jack,
significantly indicating his rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw you twice, and raised my rifle; your breeches are just
the colour of a young doe.&nbsp; Are you Meredith?&nbsp; My name is
Oscard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Yes, I am Meredith.&nbsp; I am glad to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They shook hands.&nbsp; There was a twinkle in Jack Meredith&rsquo;s
eyes, but Oscard was quite grave.&nbsp; His sense of humour was not
very keen, and he was before all things a sportsman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left the canoes a mile below Msala, and landed to shoot
a deer we saw drinking, but I never saw him.&nbsp; Then I heard you,
and I have been stalking you ever since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I never expected you so soon; you were not due till&mdash;look!&rdquo;
Jack whispered suddenly.</p>
<p>Oscard turned on his heel, and the next instant their two rifles
rang out through the forest stillness in one sharp crack.&nbsp; Across
the stream, ten yards behind the spot where Oscard had emerged from
the bush, a leopard sprang into the air, five feet from the ground,
with head thrown back, and paws clawing at the thinness of space with
grand free sweeps.&nbsp; The beast fell with a thud, and lay still&mdash;dead.</p>
<p>The two men clambered across the rocks again, side by side.&nbsp;
While they stood over the prostrate form of the leopard&mdash;beautiful,
incomparably graceful and sleek even in death&mdash;Guy Oscard stole
a sidelong glance at his companion.&nbsp; He was a modest man, and yet
he knew that he was reckoned among the big-game hunters of the age.&nbsp;
This man had fired as quickly as himself, and there were two small trickling
holes in the animal&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>While he was being quietly scrutinised Jack Meredith stooped down,
and, taking the leopard beneath the shoulders, lifted it bodily back
from the pool of blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pity to spoil the skin,&rdquo; he explained, as he put a fresh
cartridge into his rifle.</p>
<p>Oscard nodded in an approving way.&nbsp; He knew the weight of a
full-grown male leopard, all muscle and bone, and he was one of those
old-fashioned persons mentioned in the Scriptures as taking a delight
in a man&rsquo;s legs&mdash;or his arms, so long as they were strong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;we had better skin
him here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke he drew a long hunting-knife, and, slashing down a bunch
of the maidenhair fern that grew like nettles around them, he wiped
the blood gently, almost affectionately, from the leopard&rsquo;s cat-like
face.</p>
<p>There was about these two men a strict attention to the matter in
hand, a mutual and common respect for all things pertaining to sport,
a quiet sense of settling down without delay to the regulation of necessary
detail that promised well for any future interest they might have in
common.</p>
<p>So these highly-educated young gentlemen turned up their sleeves
and steeped themselves to the elbow in gore.&nbsp; Moreover, they did
it with a certain technical skill and a distinct sense of enjoyment.&nbsp;
Truly, the modern English gentleman is a strange being.&nbsp; There
is nothing his soul takes so much delight in as the process of getting
hot and very dirty, and, if convenient, somewhat sanguinary.&nbsp; You
cannot educate the manliness out of him, try as you will; and for such
blessings let us in all humbleness give thanks to Heaven.</p>
<p>This was the bringing together of Jack Meredith and Guy Oscard&mdash;two
men who loved the same woman.&nbsp; They knelt side by side, and Jack
Meredith&mdash;the older man, the accomplished, gifted gentleman of
the world, who stood second to none in that varied knowledge required
nowadays of the successful societarian&mdash;Jack Meredith, be it noted,
humbly dragged the skin away from the body while Guy Oscard cut the
clinging integuments with a delicate touch and finished skill.</p>
<p>They laid the skin out on the trampled maidenhair, and contemplated
it with silent satisfaction.&nbsp; In the course of their inspection
they both arrived at the head at the same moment.&nbsp; The two holes
in the hide, just above the eyes, came under their notice at the same
moment, and they turned and smiled gravely at each other, thinking the
same thought&mdash;the sort of thought that Englishmen rarely put into
intelligible English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we did that,&rdquo; said Guy Oscard at length,
suddenly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whatever comes of this expedition of ours&mdash;if
we fight like hell, as we probably shall, before it is finished&mdash;if
we hate each other ever afterwards, that skin ought to remind us that
we are much of a muchness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It might have been put into better English; it might almost have
sounded like poetry had Guy Oscard been possessed of the poetic soul.&nbsp;
But this, fortunately, was not his; and all that might have been said
was left to the imagination of Meredith.&nbsp; What he really felt was
that there need be no rivalry, and that he for one had no thought of
such; that in the quest which they were about to undertake there need
be no question of first and last; that they were merely two men, good
or bad, competent or incompetent, but through all equal.</p>
<p>Neither of them suspected that the friendship thus strangely inaugurated
at the rifle&rsquo;s mouth was to run through a longer period than the
few months required to reach the plateau&mdash;that it was, in fact,
to extend through that long expedition over a strange country that we
call Life, and that it was to stand the greatest test that friendship
has to meet with here on earth.</p>
<p>It was almost dark when at last they turned to go, Jack Meredith
carrying the skin over his shoulder and leading the way.&nbsp; There
was no opportunity for conversation, as their progress was necessarily
very difficult.&nbsp; Only by the prattle of the stream were they able
to make sure of keeping in the right direction.&nbsp; Each had a thousand
questions to ask the other.&nbsp; They were total strangers; but it
is not, one finds, by conversation that men get to know each other.&nbsp;
A common danger, a common pleasure, a common pursuit&mdash;these are
the touches of Nature by which men are drawn together into the kinship
of mutual esteem.</p>
<p>Once they gained the banks of the Ogowe their progress was quicker,
and by nine o&rsquo;clock they reached the camp at Msala.&nbsp; Victor
Durnovo was still at work superintending the discharge of the baggage
and stores from the large trading-canoes.&nbsp; They heard the shouting
and chattering before coming in sight of the camp, and one voice raised
angrily above the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that Durnovo&rsquo;s voice?&rdquo; asked Meredith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered his companion curtly.</p>
<p>It was a new voice which Meredith had not heard before.&nbsp; When
they shouted to announce their arrival it was suddenly hushed, and presently
Durnovo came forward to greet them.</p>
<p>Meredith hardly knew him, he was so much stronger and healthier in
appearance.&nbsp; Durnovo shook hands heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need to introduce you two,&rdquo; he said, looking from
one to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; after one mistake we discovered each other&rsquo;s identity
in the forest,&rdquo; answered Meredith.</p>
<p>Durnovo smiled; but there was something behind the smile.&nbsp; He
did not seem to approve of their meeting without his intervention.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.&nbsp; IN BLACK AND WHITE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>A little lurking secret of the blood,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
little serpent secret rankling keen.</i></p>
<p>The three men walked up towards the house together.&nbsp; It was
a fair-sized house, with a heavy thatched roof that overhung the walls
like the crown of a mushroom.&nbsp; The walls were only mud, and the
thatching was nothing else than banana leaves; but there was evidence
of European taste in the garden surrounding the structure, and in the
glazed windows and wooden door.</p>
<p>As they approached the open doorway three little children, clad in
very little more than their native modesty, ran gleefully out, and proceeded
to engage seats on Jack Meredith&rsquo;s boots, looking upon him as
a mere public conveyance.&nbsp; They took hardly any notice of him,
but chattered and quarrelled among themselves, sometimes in baby English,
sometimes in a dialect unknown to Oscard and Meredith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These,&rdquo; said the latter, when they were seated, and
clinging with their little dusky arms round his legs, &ldquo;are the
very rummest little kids I ever came across.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Durnovo gave an impatient laugh, and went on towards the house.&nbsp;
But Guy Oscard stopped, and walked more slowly beside Meredith as he
laboured along heavy footed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are the jolliest little souls imaginable,&rdquo; continued
Jack Meredith.&nbsp; &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said to them when they
had reached the doorstep, &ldquo;run away to your mother&mdash;very
fine ride&mdash;no! no more to-night!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m aweary&mdash;you
understand&mdash;aweary!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aweary&mdash;awe-e-e-ary!&rdquo; repeated the little things,
standing before him in infantile nude rotundity, looking up with bright
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aweary&mdash;that is it.&nbsp; Good night, Epaminondas&mdash;good
night, Xantippe!&nbsp; Give ye good hap, most stout Nestorius!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stooped and gravely shook hands with each one in turn, and, after
forcing a like ceremonial upon Guy Oscard, they reluctantly withdrew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have not joined us, I suppose?&rdquo; said Oscard, as
he followed his companion into the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&nbsp; They live in this place.&nbsp; Nestorius, I
understand, takes care of his mother, who, in her turn, takes care of
this house.&nbsp; He is one and a half.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy Oscard seemed to have inherited the mind inquisitive from his
learned father.&nbsp; He asked another question later on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that woman?&rdquo; he said during dinner, with a little
nod towards the doorway, through which the object of his curiosity had
passed with some plates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the mother of the stout Nestorius,&rdquo; answered
Jack&mdash;&ldquo;Durnovo&rsquo;s housekeeper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke quietly, looking straight in front of him; and Joseph, who
was drawing a cork at the back of the room, was watching his face.</p>
<p>There was a little pause, during which Durnovo drank slowly.&nbsp;
Then Guy Oscard spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she cooked the dinner,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;she knows
her business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Durnovo, &ldquo;she is a good cook&mdash;if
she is nothing else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It did not sound as if further inquiries would be welcome, and so
the subject was dropped with a silent tribute to the culinary powers
of Durnovo&rsquo;s housekeeper at the Msala Station.</p>
<p>The woman had only appeared for a moment, bringing in some dishes
for Joseph&mdash;a tall, stately woman, with great dark eyes, in which
the patience of motherhood had succeeded to the soft fire of West Indian
love and youth.&nbsp; She had the graceful, slow carriage of the Creole,
although her skin was darker than that of those dangerous sirens.&nbsp;
That Spanish blood ran in her veins could be seen by the intelligence
of her eyes; for there is an intelligence in Spanish eyes which stand
apart.&nbsp; In the men it seems to refer to the past or the future,
for their incorrigible leisureliness prevents the present rendering
of a full justice to their powers.&nbsp; In the women it belongs essentially
to the present; for there is no time like the present for love and other
things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They call me,&rdquo; she had said to Jack Meredith, in her
soft, mumbled English, a fortnight earlier, &ldquo;they call me Marie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children he had named after his own phantasy, and when she had
once seen him with them there was a notable change in her manner.&nbsp;
Her eyes rested on him with a sort of wondering attention, and when
she cooked his meals or touched anything that was his there was something
in her attitude that denoted a special care.</p>
<p>Joseph called her &ldquo;Missis,&rdquo; with a sort of friendliness
in his voice, which never rose to badinage nor descended to familiarity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me, missis,&rdquo; he said, on the third evening
after the arrival of the advance column, &ldquo;that the guv&rsquo;nor
takes uncommon kindly to them little &rsquo;uns of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were washing up together after dinner in that part of the garden
which was used for a scullery, and Joseph was enjoying a post-prandial
pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said simply, following the direction of Joseph&rsquo;s
glance.&nbsp; Jack Meredith was engaged in teaching Epaminondas the
intellectual game of bowls with a rounded pebble and a beer-bottle.&nbsp;
Nestorius, whose person seemed more distended than usual, stood gravely
by, engaged in dental endeavours on a cork, while Xantippe joined noisily
in the game.&nbsp; Their lack of dress was essentially native to the
country, while their mother affected a simple European style of costume.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; added Joseph, on politeness bent, &ldquo;it don&rsquo;t
surprise me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m wonderfully fond of the little nig&mdash;nippers
already.&nbsp; I am&mdash;straight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The truth was that the position of this grave and still comely woman
was ambiguous.&nbsp; Neither Joseph nor his master called her by the
name she had offered for their use.&nbsp; Joseph compromised by the
universal and elastic &ldquo;Missis&rdquo;; his master simply avoided
all names.</p>
<p>Ambiguity is one of those intangible nothings that get into the atmosphere
and have a trick of remaining there.&nbsp; Marie seemed in some subtle
way to pervade the atmosphere of Msala.&nbsp; It would seem that Guy
Oscard, in his thick-headed way, was conscious of this mystery in the
air; for he had not been two hours in Msala before he asked &ldquo;Who
is that woman?&rdquo; and received the reply which has been recorded.</p>
<p>After dinner they passed out on to the little terrace overlooking
the river, and it was here that the great Simiacine scheme was pieced
together.&nbsp; It was here beneath the vast palm trees that stood like
two beacons towering over the surrounding forest, that three men deliberately
staked their own lives and the lives of others against a fortune.&nbsp;
Nature has a strange way of hiding her gifts.&nbsp; Many of the most
precious have lain unheeded for hundreds of years in barren plains,
on inaccessible mountains, or beneath the wave, while others are thrown
at the feet of savages who know no use for them.</p>
<p>The man who had found the Simiacine was eager, restless, full of
suspicion.&nbsp; To the others the scheme obviously presented itself
in a different light.&nbsp; Jack Meredith was <i>dilettante</i>, light-hearted,
and unsatisfactory.&nbsp; It was impossible to arouse any enthusiasm
in him&mdash;to make him take it seriously.&nbsp; Guy Oscard was gravely
indifferent.&nbsp; He wanted to get rid of a certain space of time,
and the African forest, containing as it did the only excitement that
his large heart knew, was as good a place as any.&nbsp; The Simiacine
was, in his mind, relegated to a distant place behind weeks of sport
and adventure such as his soul loved.&nbsp; He scarcely took Victor
Durnovo <i>au pied de la lettre</i>.&nbsp; Perhaps he knew too much
about him for that.&nbsp; Certain it is that neither of the two realised
at that moment the importance of the step that they were taking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You men,&rdquo; said Durnovo eagerly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t seem
to take the thing seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; answered Meredith, &ldquo;intend at all events to
take the profits very seriously.&nbsp; When they begin to come in, J.
Meredith will be at the above address, and trusts by a careful attention
to business to merit a continuance of your kind patronage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Durnovo laughed somewhat nervously.&nbsp; Oscard did not seem to
hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all very well for you,&rdquo; said the half-caste in
a lower voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have not so much at stake.&nbsp; It
is likely that the happiness of my whole life depends upon this venture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A curious smile passed across Jack Meredith&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; Without
turning his head, he glanced sideways into Durnovo&rsquo;s face through
the gloom.&nbsp; But he said nothing, and it was Oscard who broke the
silence by saying simply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same may possibly apply to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little pause, during which he lighted his pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To a certain extent,&rdquo; he said in emendation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of
course, my real object, as you no doubt know, is to get away from England
until my father&rsquo;s death has been forgotten.&nbsp; My own conscience
is quite clear, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack Meredith drew in his legs and leant forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he said, interrupting, and yet not interrupting&mdash;&ldquo;but
the public mind is an unclean sink.&nbsp; Everything that goes into
it comes out tainted.&nbsp; Therefore it is best only to let the public
mind have the scourings, as it were, of one&rsquo;s existence.&nbsp;
If they get anything better&mdash;anything more important&mdash;it is
better to skedaddle until it has run through and been swept away by
a flow of social garbage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy Oscard grunted with his pipe between his teeth, after the manner
of the stoic American-Indian&mdash;a grunt that seemed to say, &ldquo;My
pale-faced brother has spoken well; he expresses my feelings.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then he gave further vent to the deliberate expansiveness which was
his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I cannot stand,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are the nudges
and the nods and the surreptitious glances of the silly women who think
that one cannot see them looking.&nbsp; I hate being pointed out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Together with the latest skirt-dancing girl, and the last
female society-detective, with the blushing honours of the witness-box
thick upon her,&rdquo; suggested Jack Meredith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; muttered Guy.&nbsp; He turned with a sort of simple
wonder, and looked at Meredith curiously.&nbsp; He had never been understood
so quickly before.&nbsp; He had never met man or woman possessing in
so marked a degree that subtle power of going right inside the mind
of another and feeling the things that are there&mdash;the greatest
power of all&mdash;the power that rules the world; and it is only called
Sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the voice of Durnovo through the darkness,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind admitting that all I want is the money.&nbsp;
I want to get out of this confounded country; but I don&rsquo;t want
to leave till I have made a fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The subtle influence that Meredith wielded seemed to have reached
him too, warming into expansiveness his hot Spanish blood.&nbsp; His
voice was full of confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very right and proper,&rdquo; said Meredith.&nbsp; &ldquo;Got
a grudge against the country; make the country pay for it in cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I intend to do; and it shall pay heavily.&nbsp;
Then, when I&rsquo;ve got the money, I&rsquo;ll know what to do with
it.&nbsp; I know where to look, and I do not think that I shall look
in vain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy Oscard shuffled uneasily in his camp-chair.&nbsp; He had an Englishman&rsquo;s
horror of putting into speech those things which we all think, while
only Frenchmen and Italians say them.&nbsp; The Spaniards are not so
bad, and Victor Durnovo had enough of their blood in him to say no more.</p>
<p>It did not seem to occur to any of them that the only person whose
individuality was still veiled happened to be Jack Meredith.&nbsp; He
alone had said nothing, had imparted no confidence.&nbsp; He it was
who spake first, after a proper period of silence.&nbsp; He was too
much of an adept to betray haste, and thus admit his debt of mutual
confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that we have all the
technicalities arranged now.&nbsp; So far as the working of the expedition
is concerned, we know our places, and the difficulties will be met as
they present themselves.&nbsp; But there is one thing which I think
we should set in order now.&nbsp; I have been thinking about it while
I have been waiting here alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The glow of Victor Durnovo&rsquo;s cigar died away as if in his attention
he was forgetting to smoke; but he said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; Jack went on, &ldquo;that before we
leave here we should draw up and sign a sort of deed of partnership.&nbsp;
Of course, we trust each other perfectly&mdash;there is no question
of that.&nbsp; But life is an uncertain thing, as some earlier philosopher
said before me; and one never knows what may happen.&nbsp; I have drawn
up a paper in triplicate.&nbsp; If you have a match, I will read it
to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oscard produced a match, and, striking it on his boot, sheltered
it with the hollow of his hand, while Jack read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We, the undersigned, hereby enter into partnership to search
for and sell, to our mutual profit, the herb known as Simiacine, the
profits to be divided into three equal portions, after the deduction
of one-hundredth part to be handed to the servant, Joseph Atkinson.&nbsp;
Any further expenses that may be incurred to be borne in the same proportion
as the original expense of fitting out the expedition, namely, two-fifths
to be paid by Guy Cravener Oscard, two-fifths by John Meredith, one-fifth
by Victor Durnovo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sum of fifty pounds per month to be paid to Victor Durnovo,
wherewith he may pay the thirty special men taken from his estate and
headquarters at Msala to cultivate the Simiacine, and such corn and
vegetables as may be required for the sustenance of the expedition;
these men to act as porters until the plateau be reached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The opinion of two of the three leaders against one to be
accepted unconditionally in all questions where controversy may arise.&nbsp;
In case of death each of us undertakes hereby to hand over to the executors
of the dead partner or partners such moneys as shall belong to him or
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this juncture there was a little pause while Guy Oscard lighted
a second match.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; continued Jack, &ldquo;we hereby undertake severally,
on oath, to hold the whereabouts of the Simiacine a strict secret, which
secret may not be revealed by any one of us to whomsoever it may be
without the sanction, in writing, of the other two partners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; concluded Jack Meredith, &ldquo;I am rather
pleased with that literary production: it is forcible and yet devoid
of violence.&nbsp; I feel that in me the commerce of the century has
lost an ornament.&nbsp; Moreover, I am ready to swear to the terms of
the agreement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little pause.&nbsp; Guy Oscard took his pipe from his
mouth, and while he knocked the ashes out against the leg of his chair
he mumbled, &ldquo;I swear to hold that agreement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victor Durnovo took off his hat with a sweep and a flourish, and,
raising his bared brow to the stars, he said, &ldquo;I swear to hold
to that agreement.&nbsp; If I fail, may God strike me dead!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Is this reason?&nbsp; Is this humanity?&nbsp;
Alas! it is man.</i></p>
<p>The next morning Jack Meredith was awakened by his servant Joseph
before it was fully light.&nbsp; It would appear as if Joseph had taken
no means of awakening him, for Meredith awoke quite quietly to find
Joseph standing by his bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holloa!&rdquo; exclaimed the master, fully awake at once,
as townsmen are.</p>
<p>Joseph stood at attention by the bedside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woke you before yer time, sir,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
something wrong among these &rsquo;ere darkie fellers, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wrong! what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meredith was already lacing his shoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not rebellion?&rdquo; he said curtly, looking towards his
firearms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, not that.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s some mortual sickness.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t know what it is.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been up half the night
with them.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s spreading, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sickness! what does it seem like?&nbsp; Just give me that
jacket.&nbsp; Not that sleeping sickness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not that.&nbsp; Missis Marie was
telling me about that&mdash;awful scourge that, sir.&nbsp; No, the poor
chaps are wide-awake enough.&nbsp; Groanin&rsquo;, and off their heads
too, mostly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you called Mr. Oscard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call him and Mr. Durnovo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Met Mr. Durnovo, sir, goin&rsquo; out as I came in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few moments Jack joined Durnovo and Oscard, who were talking
together on the terrace in front of the house.&nbsp; Guy Oscard was
still in his pyjamas, which he had tucked into top-boots.&nbsp; He also
wore a sun-helmet, which added a finish to his costume.&nbsp; They got
quite accustomed to this get-up during the next three days, for he never
had time to change it; and, somehow, it ceased to be humorous long before
the end of that time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; Durnovo was saying, with a
singular eagerness.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know these chaps.&nbsp; They have
been paid in advance.&nbsp; They are probably shamming, and if they
are not they are only suffering from the effects of a farewell glorification.&nbsp;
They want to delay our start.&nbsp; That is their little game.&nbsp;
It will give them a better chance of deserting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate, we had better go and see them,&rdquo; suggested
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Durnovo eagerly, detaining him
with both hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take my advice, and don&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
Just have breakfast in the ordinary way and pretend there is nothing
wrong.&nbsp; Then afterwards you can lounge casually into the camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Jack, rather unwillingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been of some use&mdash;this scare,&rdquo; said Durnovo,
turning and looking towards the river.&nbsp; &ldquo;It has reminded
me of something.&nbsp; We have not nearly enough quinine.&nbsp; I will
just take a quick canoe, and run down to Loango to fetch some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned quite away from them, and stooped to attach the lace of
his boot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can travel night and day, and be back here in three days,&rdquo;
he added.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the meantime you can be getting on with the
loading of the canoes, and we will start as soon as I get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood upright and looked around with weatherwise, furtive eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s thunder
coming.&nbsp; I think I had better be off at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the course of his inspection of the lowering clouds which hung,
black as ink, just above the trees, his eyes lighted on Joseph, standing
within the door of the cottage, watching him with a singular half-suppressed
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said hurriedly, &ldquo;I will start at once.&nbsp;
I can eat some sort of a breakfast when we are under way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked beneath his lashes quickly from Jack to Guy and back again.&nbsp;
Their silent acquiescence was not quite satisfactory.&nbsp; Then he
called his own men, and spoke to them in a tongue unknown to the Englishmen.&nbsp;
He hurried forward their preparations with a feverish irritability which
made Jack Meredith think of the first time he had ever seen Durnovo&mdash;a
few miles farther down the river&mdash;all palpitating and trembling
with climatic nervousness.&nbsp; His face was quite yellow, and there
was a line drawn diagonally from the nostrils down each cheek, to lose
itself ultimately in the heavy black moustache.</p>
<p>Before he stepped into his canoe the thunder was rumbling in the
distance, and the air was still as death.&nbsp; Breathing was an effort;
the inhaled air did not satisfy the lungs, and seemed powerless to expand
them.</p>
<p>Overhead the clouds, of a blue-black intensity, seemed almost to
touch the trees; the river was of ink.&nbsp; The rowers said nothing,
but they lingered on the bank and watched Durnovo&rsquo;s face anxiously.&nbsp;
When he took his seat in the canoe they looked protestingly up to the
sky.&nbsp; Durnovo said something to them rapidly, and they laid their
paddles to the water.</p>
<p>Scarcely had the boat disappeared in the bend of the river before
the rain broke.&nbsp; It came with the rush of an express train&mdash;the
trees bending before the squall like reeds.&nbsp; The face of the river
was tormented into a white fury by the drops which splashed up again
a foot in height.&nbsp; The lashing of the water on the bare backs of
the negroes was distinctly audible to Victor Durnovo.</p>
<p>Then the black clouds split up like a rent cloth, and showed behind
them, not Heaven, but the living fire of Hell.&nbsp; The thunder crashed
out in sharp reports like file-firing at a review.&nbsp; With one accord
the men ceased rowing and crouched down in the canoe.</p>
<p>Durnovo shouted to them, his face livid with fury.&nbsp; But for
some moments his voice was quite lost.&nbsp; The lightning ran over
the face of the river like will-o&rsquo;-the-wisps; the whole heaven
was streaked continuously with it.</p>
<p>Suddenly the negroes leaped to their paddles and rowed with bent
back, and wild staring eyes, as if possessed.&nbsp; They were covered
by the muzzle of Durnovo&rsquo;s revolver.</p>
<p>Behind the evil-looking barrel of blue steel, the half-caste&rsquo;s
dripping face looked forth, peering into the terrific storm.&nbsp; There
was no question of fending off such torrents of rain, nor did he attempt
it.&nbsp; Indeed, he seemed to court its downfall.&nbsp; He held out
his arms and stretched forth his legs, giving free play to the water
which ran off him in a continual stream, washing his thin khaki clothing
on his limbs.&nbsp; He raised his face to the sky, and let the water
beat upon his brow and hair.</p>
<p>The roar of the thunder, which could be <i>felt</i>, so great was
the vibration of the laden air, seemed to have no fear for him.&nbsp;
The lightning, ever shooting athwart the sky, made him blink as if dazzled,
but he looked upon it without emotion.</p>
<p>He knew that behind him he had left a greater danger than this, and
he stretched out his limbs to the cleansing torrent with an exulting
relief to be washed from the dread infection.&nbsp; Small-pox had laid
its hand on the camp at Msala: and from the curse of it Victor Durnovo
was flying in a mad chattering panic through all the anger of the tropic
elements, holding death over his half-stunned crew, not daring to look
behind him or pause in his coward&rsquo;s flight.</p>
<p>It is still said on the Ogowe river that no man travels like Victor
Durnovo.&nbsp; Certain it is that, in twenty-seven hours from the time
that he left Msala on the morning of the great storm, he presented himself
before Maurice Gordon in his office at the factory at Loango.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Gordon, hardly noticing the washed-out, harassed
appearance of the visitor; &ldquo;here you are again.&nbsp; I heard
that the great expedition had started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it has, but I have come back to get one or two things we
have forgotten.&nbsp; Got any sherry handy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Gordon, with perfect adhesion to
the truth.</p>
<p>He laid aside his pen and, turning in his chair, drew a decanter
from a small cupboard which stood on the ground at his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are,&rdquo; he continued, pouring out a full glass
with practised, but slightly unsteady, hand.</p>
<p>Durnovo drank the wine at one gulp and set the glass down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that does a chap good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it now?&rdquo; exclaimed Maurice Gordon with mock surprise.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll just try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The manner in which he emptied his glass was quite different, with
a long, slow drawing-out of the enjoyment, full of significance for
the initiated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you be at home to-night?&rdquo; asked Durnovo, gently
pushing aside the hospitable decanter.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have got a lot
of work to do to-day, but I should like to run in and see you this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, come and dine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Durnovo shook his head and looked down at his wrinkled and draggled
clothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t do that, old man.&nbsp; Not in this trim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bosh?&nbsp; What matter?&nbsp; Jocelyn doesn&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was obvious that he wanted to accept the invitation, although
the objection he raised was probably honest.&nbsp; For that taint in
the blood that cometh from the subtle tar-brush brings with it a vanity
that has its equal in no white man&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll lend you a black coat!&nbsp; Seven o&rsquo;clock
sharp!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Durnovo hurried away with a gleam of excitement in his dark eyes.</p>
<p>Maurice Gordon did not resume his work at once.&nbsp; He sat for
some time idly drumming with his fingers on the desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can only get her to be civil to him,&rdquo; he reflected
aloud, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get into this business yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At seven o&rsquo;clock Durnovo appeared at the Gordons&rsquo; house.&nbsp;
He had managed to borrow a dress-suit, and wore an orchid in his buttonhole.&nbsp;
It was probably the first time that Jocelyn had seen him in this garb
of civilisation, which is at the same time the most becoming and the
most trying variety of costume left to sensible men in these days.&nbsp;
A dress-suit finds a man out sooner than anything except speech.</p>
<p>Jocelyn was civil in her reception&mdash;more so, indeed, than Maurice
Gordon had hoped for.&nbsp; She seemed almost glad to see Durnovo, and
evinced quite a kindly interest in his movements.&nbsp; Durnovo attributed
this to the dress-suit, while Maurice concluded that his obvious hints,
thrown out before dinner, had fallen on fruitful ground.</p>
<p>At dinner Victor Durnovo was quite charmed with the interest that
Jocelyn took in the expedition, of which, he gave it to be understood,
he was the chief.&nbsp; So also was Maurice, because Durnovo&rsquo;s
evident admiration of Jocelyn somewhat overcame his natural secrecy
of character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear of me, Miss Gordon, never fear, before three
months are past,&rdquo; said Durnovo, in reply to a vague suggestion
that his absence might extend to several months.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not
the sort of man to come to grief by a foolish mistake or any unnecessary
risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which sentiment two men at Msala bore generous testimony later
on.</p>
<p>The simple dinner was almost at an end, and it was at this time that
Jocelyn Gordon began once more to dislike Durnovo.&nbsp; At first she
had felt drawn towards him.&nbsp; Although he wore the dress-clothes
rather awkwardly, there was something in his manner which reminded her
vaguely of a gentleman.&nbsp; It was not that he was exactly gentlemanly,
but there was the reflection of good breeding in his bearing.&nbsp;
Dark-skinned people, be it noted, have usually the imitative faculty.&nbsp;
As the dinner and the wine warmed his heart, so by degrees he drew on
his old self like a glove.&nbsp; He grew bolder and less guarded.&nbsp;
His opinion of himself rose momentarily, and with it a certain gleam
in his eyes increased as they rested on Jocelyn.</p>
<p>It was not long before she noted this, and quite suddenly her ancient
dislike of the man was up in arms with a new intensity gathered she
knew not whence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; said Maurice, when Jocelyn had left them, &ldquo;I
suppose you&rsquo;ll be a millionaire in about six months?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gently pushed the wine towards him at the same time.&nbsp; Durnovo
had not slept for forty hours.&nbsp; The excitement of his escape from
the plague-ridden camp had scarcely subsided.&nbsp; The glitter of the
silver on the table, the shaded candles, the subtle sensuality of refinement
and daintiness appealed to his hot-blooded nature.&nbsp; He was a little
off his feet perhaps.&nbsp; He took the decanter and put it to the worst
use he could have selected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so soon as that,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but in time&mdash;in
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky beggar!&rdquo; muttered Maurice Gordon, with a little
sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind telling you,&rdquo; said Durnovo, with
a sudden confidence begotten of Madeira, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s Simiacine&mdash;that&rsquo;s
what it is.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t tell you more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simiacine,&rdquo; repeated Gordon, fingering the stem of his
wine-glass and looking at him keenly between the candle-shades.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve always been on its track, haven&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In six months your go-downs will be full of it&mdash;my Simiacine,
my Simiacine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By God, I wish I had a hand in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maurice Gordon pushed the decanter again&mdash;gently, almost surreptitiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you may, some day.&nbsp; You help me and I&rsquo;ll
help you&mdash;that is my ticket.&nbsp; Reciprocity&mdash;reciprocity,
my dear Maurice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell you now, but I will in good time&mdash;in
my own time.&nbsp; Come, let&rsquo;s join the ladies&mdash;eh? haha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But at this moment the servant brought in coffee, saying in his master&rsquo;s
ear that Miss Jocelyn had gone to bed with a slight headache.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.&nbsp; A CONFIDENCE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The
spirits<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of coming things stride on
before their issues.</i></p>
<p>There is nothing that brings men so close to each other as a common
grievance or a common danger.&nbsp; Men who find pleasure in the same
game or the same pursuit are drawn together by a common taste; but in
the indulgence of it there is sure to arise, sooner or later, a spirit
of competition.&nbsp; Now, this spirit, which is in most human affairs,
is a new bond of union when men are fighting side by side against a
common foe.</p>
<p>During the three days that followed Durnovo&rsquo;s departure from
Msala, Jack Meredith and Oscard learnt to know each other.&nbsp; These
three days were as severe a test as could well be found; for courage,
humanity, tenderness, loyalty, were by turns called forth by circumstance.&nbsp;
Smallpox rages in Africa as it rages nowhere else in these days.&nbsp;
The natives fight it or bow before it as before an ancient and deeply
dreaded foe.&nbsp; It was nothing new to them, and it would have been
easy enough for Jack and Oscard to prove to their own satisfaction that
the presence of three white men at Msala was a danger to themselves
and no advantage to the natives.&nbsp; It would have been very simple
to abandon the river station, leaving there such men as were stricken
down to care for each other.&nbsp; But such a thought never seemed to
suggest itself.</p>
<p>The camp was moved across the river, where all who seemed strong
and healthy were placed under canvas, awaiting further developments.</p>
<p>The infected were carried to a special camp set apart and guarded,
and this work was executed almost entirely by the three Englishmen,
aided by a few natives who had had the disease.</p>
<p>For three days these men went about with their lives literally in
their hands, tending the sick, cheering the despondent, frightening
the cowards into some semblance of self-respect and dignity.&nbsp; And
during these three days, wherein they never took an organised meal or
three consecutive hours of rest, Joseph, Meredith, and Oscard rose together
to that height of manhood where master and servant, educated man and
common soldier, stand equal before their Maker.</p>
<p>Owing to the promptness with which measures had been taken for isolating
the affected, the terrible sickness did not spread.&nbsp; In all eleven
men were stricken, and of these ten died within three days.&nbsp; The
eleventh recovered, but eventually remained at Msala.</p>
<p>It was only on the evening of the third day that Jack and Guy found
time to talk of the future.&nbsp; They had never left Durnovo&rsquo;s
house, and on this third day they found time to dine together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; Oscard asked bluntly, when they were
left alone to smoke, &ldquo;that Durnovo knew what was the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid that I have not the slightest doubt of it,&rdquo;
replied Jack lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And bolted?&rdquo; suggested Oscard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And bolted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy Oscard gave a contemptuous little laugh, which had a deeper insult
in it than he could have put into words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is to be done?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&nbsp; People in books would mount on a very high
pinnacle of virtue and cast off Mr. Durnovo and all his works; but it
is much more practical to make what use we can of him.&nbsp; That is
a worldly-wise, nineteenth-century way of looking at it; we cannot do
without him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The contemplativeness of nicotine was upon Guy Oscard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Umph!&rdquo; he grunted.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is rather disgusting,&rdquo;
he said, after a pause; &ldquo;I hate dealing with cowards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I with fools.&nbsp; For everyday use, give me a coward
by preference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is something in that.&nbsp; Still, I&rsquo;d throw
up the whole thing if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So would I,&rdquo; said Jack, turning sharply in his chair,
&ldquo;if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oscard laughed curtly and waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If,&rdquo; continued Jack, &ldquo;I could.&nbsp; But I am
more or less bound to go on now.&nbsp; Such chances as this do not turn
up every day; I cannot afford to let it go by.&nbsp; Truth is, I told&mdash;some
one who shall be nameless&mdash;that I would make money to keep her
in that state of life wherein her godfathers, etc., have placed her;
and make that money I must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is about my position too,&rdquo; said Guy Oscard, somewhat
indistinctly, owing to the fact that he habitually smoked a thick-stemmed
pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad of that.&nbsp; It gives us something
in common to work for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Guy paused, and made a huge effort, finally
conquering that taciturnity which was almost an affliction to him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The reason I gave the other night to you and that chap Durnovo
was honest enough, but I have another.&nbsp; I want to lie low for a
few months, but I also want to make money.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m as good as
engaged to be married, and I find that I am not so well off as I thought
I was.&nbsp; People told me that I should have three thousand a year
when the governor died, but I find that people know less of my affairs
than I thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They invariably do,&rdquo; put in Jack encouragingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is barely two thousand, and&mdash;and she has been brought
up to something better than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um! they mostly are.&nbsp; Mine has been brought up to something
better than that too.&nbsp; That is the worst of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack Meredith leant back in his folding chair, and gazed practically
up into the heavens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Guy went on, doggedly expansive now that
he had once plunged, &ldquo;two thousand a year sounds pretty good,
and it is not bad to start upon.&nbsp; But there is no chance of its
increasing; in fact, the lawyer fellows say it may diminish.&nbsp; I
know of no other way to make money&mdash;had no sort of training for
it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not of a commercial turn of mind.&nbsp; Fellows
go into the City and brew beer or float companies, whatever that may
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means they sink other people&rsquo;s funds,&rdquo; explained
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose it does.&nbsp; The guv&rsquo;nor, y&rsquo;
know, never taught me how to make a livelihood; wouldn&rsquo;t let me
be a soldier; sent me to college, and all that; wanted me to be a <i>litt&eacute;rateur</i>.&nbsp;
Now I&rsquo;m not literary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I shouldn&rsquo;t think you were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remains Africa.&nbsp; I am not a clever chap, like you, Meredith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For which you may thank a gracious Providence,&rdquo; interposed
Jack.&nbsp; &ldquo;Chaps like me are what some people call &lsquo;fools&rsquo;
in their uncouth way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I know a little about Africa, and I know something about
Durnovo.&nbsp; That man has got a mania, and it is called Simiacine.&nbsp;
He is quite straight upon that point, whatever he may be upon others.&nbsp;
He knows this country, and he is not making any mistake about the Simiacine,
whatever&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His powers of sick-nursing may be,&rdquo; suggested Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll put it that way if
you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, I do prefer it.&nbsp; Any fool could call a spade
a spade.&nbsp; The natural ambition would be to find something more
flowery and yet equally descriptive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy Oscard subsided into a monosyllabic sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe implicitly in this scheme,&rdquo; he went on, after
a pause.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a certain fact that the men who can supply
pure Simiacine have only to name their price for it.&nbsp; They will
make a fortune, and I believe that Durnovo knows where it is growing
in quantities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot see how it would pay him to deceive us in the matter.&nbsp;
That is the best way of looking at it,&rdquo; murmured Jack reflectively.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When I first met him, the man thought he was dying, and for the
time I really believe that he was honest.&nbsp; Some men are honest
when they feel unwell.&nbsp; There was so little doubt in my mind that
I went into the thing at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will go on with it I will stand by you,&rdquo; said
Oscard shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; I think we two together are as good as any half-bred
sharper on this coast, to put it gracefully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack Meredith lighted a fresh cigarette, and leant back with the
somewhat exaggerated grace of movement which was in reality partly attributable
to natural litheness.&nbsp; For some time they smoked in silence, subject
to the influence of the dreamy tropic night.&nbsp; Across the river
some belated bird was calling continuously and cautiously for its mate.&nbsp;
At times the splashing movements of a crocodile broke the smooth silence
of the water.&nbsp; Overhead the air was luminous with that night-glow
which never speaks to the senses in latitudes above the teens.</p>
<p>There is something in man&rsquo;s nature that inclines him sympathetically&mdash;almost
respectfully&mdash;towards a mental inferior.&nbsp; Moreover, the feeling,
whatever it may be, is rarely, if ever, found in women.&nbsp; A man
does not openly triumph in victory, as do women.&nbsp; One sees an easy
victor&mdash;at lawn tennis, for instance&mdash;go to his vanquished
foe, wiping vigorously a brow that is scarcely damp, and explaining
more or less lamely how it came about.&nbsp; But the same rarely happens
in the &ldquo;ladies&rsquo; singles.&rdquo;&nbsp; What, to quote another
instance, is more profound than the contempt bestowed by the girl with
the good figure upon her who has no figure at all?&nbsp; Without claiming
the virtue of a greater generosity for the sex, one may, perhaps, assume
that men learn by experience the danger of despising any man.&nbsp;
The girl with the good figure is sometimes&mdash;nay, often&mdash;found
blooming alone in her superiority, while the despised competitor is
a happy mother of children.&nbsp; And all this to explain that Jack
Meredith felt drawn towards his great hulking companion by something
that was not a mere respect of mind for matter.</p>
<p>As love is inexplicable, so is friendship.&nbsp; No man can explain
why David held Jonathan in such high esteem.&nbsp; Between men it would
appear that admiration is no part of friendship.&nbsp; And such as have
the patience to follow the lives of the two Englishmen thus brought
together by a series of chances will perhaps be able to discover in
this record of a great scheme the reason why Jack Meredith, the brilliant,
the gifted, should bestow upon Guy Oscard such a wealth of love and
esteem as he never received in return.</p>
<p>During the silence Jack was apparently meditating over the debt of
confidence which he still owed to his companion; for he spoke first,
and spoke seriously, about himself, which was somewhat against his habit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay you have heard,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I had
a&mdash;a disagreement with my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Heard something about it,&rdquo; replied Oscard,
in a tone which seemed to imply that the &ldquo;something&rdquo; was
quite sufficient for his requirements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was about my engagement,&rdquo; Jack went on deliberately.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I do not know how it was, but they did not hit it off together.&nbsp;
She was too honest to throw herself at his head, I suppose; for I imagine
a pretty girl can usually do what she likes with an old man if she takes
the trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not with him, I think.&nbsp; Seemed to be rather down on girls
in general,&rdquo; said Oscard coolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a little.&nbsp; I have met him once or twice, out, you
know.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t suppose he would know me again if he saw me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which last remark does not redound to the credit of Guy&rsquo;s powers
of observation.</p>
<p>They paused.&nbsp; It is wonderful how near we may stand to the brink
and look far away beyond the chasm.&nbsp; Years afterwards they remembered
this conversation, and it is possible that Jack Meredith wondered then
what instinct it was that made him change the direction of their thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is agreeable to you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think
it would be wise for me to go down to Loango, and gently intimate to
Durnovo that we should be glad of his services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He cannot be buying quinine all this time, you know.&nbsp;
He said he would travel night and day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oscard nodded gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How will you put it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I would simply say that his non-arrival caused us
some anxiety, and that I had come down to see if anything was wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack rose and threw away the end of his cigarette.&nbsp; It was quite
late, and across the river the gleam of the moonlight on fixed bayonets
told that only the sentries were astir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what about the small-pox?&rdquo; pursued Oscard, more
with the desire to learn than to amend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think I shall say anything about that.&nbsp; The
man wants careful handling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have to tell him that we have got it under.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll do that.&nbsp; Good-night, old fellow; I shall
be off by daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By seven o&rsquo;clock the next morning the canoe was ready, with
its swarthy rowers in their places.&nbsp; The two Englishmen breakfasted
together, and then walked down to the landing-stage side by side.</p>
<p>It was raining steadily, and the atmosphere had that singular feeling
of total relaxation and limpness which is only to be felt in the rain-ridden
districts of Central Africa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care of yourself,&rdquo; said Oscard gruffly as Jack
stepped into the canoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And bring back Durnovo with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack Meredith looked up with a vague smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man,&rdquo; he said lightly, &ldquo;is going to the Plateau
if I have to drag him there by the scruff of the neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he believed that he was thinking of the expedition only.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.&nbsp; WAR</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Who, when they slash and cut to
pieces,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do so with civilest addresses.</i></p>
<p>There is no power so subtle and so strong as that of association.&nbsp;
We have learnt to associate mustard with beef, and therefore mustard
shall be eaten with beef until the day when the lion shall lie down
with the lamb.</p>
<p>Miss Millicent Chyne became aware, as the year advanced towards the
sere and yellow leaf, that in opposing her wayward will in single combat
against a simple little association in the public mind she was undertaking
a somewhat herculean task.</p>
<p>Society&mdash;itself an association&mdash;is the slave of a word,
and society had acquired the habit of coupling the names of Sir John
Meredith and Lady Cantourne.&nbsp; They belonged to the same generation;
they had similar tastes; they were both of some considerable power in
the world of leisured pleasure; and, lastly, they amused each other.&nbsp;
The result is not far to seek.&nbsp; Wherever the one was invited, the
other was considered to be in demand; and Millicent found herself face
to face with a huge difficulty.</p>
<p>Sir John was distinctly in the way.&nbsp; He had a keener eye than
the majority of young men, and occasionally exercised the old man&rsquo;s
privilege of saying outright things which, despite theory, are better
left unsaid.&nbsp; Moreover, the situation was ill-defined, and an ill-defined
situation does not improve in the keeping.&nbsp; Sir John said sharp
things&mdash;too sharp even for Millicent&mdash;and, in addition to
the original grudge begotten of his quarrel with Jack and its result,
the girl nourished an ever-present feeling of resentment at a persistency
in misunderstanding her of which she shrewdly suspected the existence.</p>
<p>Perhaps the worst of it was that Sir John never said anything which
could be construed into direct disapproval.&nbsp; He merely indicated,
in passing, the possession of a keen eyesight coupled with the embarrassing
faculty of adding together correctly two small numerals.</p>
<p>When, therefore, Millicent allowed herself to be assisted from the
carriage at the door of a large midland country house by an eager and
lively little French baron of her acquaintance, she was disgusted but
not surprised to see a well-known figure leaning gracefully on a billiard-cue
in the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could think that this pleasure was mutual,&rdquo;
said Sir John with his courtliest smile, as he bowed over Millicent&rsquo;s
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be,&rdquo; with a coquettish glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were not afraid of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John turned, smiling, to greet Lady Cantourne.&nbsp; He did not
appear to have heard, but in reality the remark had made a distinct
impression on him.&nbsp; It signalised a new departure&mdash;the attack
at a fresh quarter.&nbsp; Millicent had tried most methods&mdash;and
she possessed many&mdash;hitherto in vain.&nbsp; She had attempted to
coax him with a filial playfulness of demeanour, to dazzle him by a
brilliancy which had that effect upon the majority of men in her train,
to win him by respectful affection; but the result had been failure.&nbsp;
She was now bringing her last reserve up to the front; and there are
few things more dangerous, even to an old campaigner, than a confession
of fear from the lips of a pretty girl.</p>
<p>Sir John Meredith gave himself a little jerk&mdash;a throw back of
the shoulders which was habitual&mdash;which might have been a tribute
either to Millicent behind, or to Lady Cantourne in front.</p>
<p>The pleasantest part of existence in a large country house full of
visitors is the facility with which one may avoid those among the guests
for whom one has no sympathy.&nbsp; Millicent managed very well to avoid
Sir John Meredith.&nbsp; The baron was her slave&mdash;at least he said
so&mdash;and she easily kept him at her beck and call during the first
evening.</p>
<p>It would seem that that strange hollow energy of old age had laid
its hand upon Sir John Meredith, for he was the first to appear in the
breakfast-room the next morning.&nbsp; He went straight to the sideboard
where the letters and newspapers lay in an orderly heap.&nbsp; It is
a question whether he had not come down early on purpose to look for
a letter.&nbsp; Perhaps he could not stay in his bed with the knowledge
that the postman had called.&nbsp; He was possibly afraid to ask his
old servant to go down and fetch his letters.</p>
<p>His bent and knotted hands fumbled among the correspondence, and
suddenly his twitching lips were still.&nbsp; A strange stillness indeed
overcame his whole face, turning it to stone.&nbsp; The letter was there;
it had come, but it was not addressed to him.</p>
<p>Sir John Meredith took up the missive; he looked at the back, turned
it, and examined the handwriting of his own son.&nbsp; There was a whole
volume&mdash;filled with pride, and love, and unquenchable resolve&mdash;written
on his face.&nbsp; He threw the letter down among its fellows, and his
hand went fumbling weakly at his lips.&nbsp; He gazed, blinking his
lashless lids, at the heap of letters, and the corner of another envelope
presently arrested his attention.&nbsp; It was of the same paper, of
the same shape and hue, as that addressed to Miss Chyne.&nbsp; Sir John
drew a deep breath, and reached out his hand.&nbsp; The letter had come
at last.&nbsp; At last, thank God!&nbsp; And how weakly ready he was
to grasp at the olive branch held out to him across a continent!</p>
<p>He took the letter; he made a step with it towards the door, seeking
solitude; then, as an afterthought, he looked at the superscription.&nbsp;
It was addressed to the same person, Miss Chyne, but in a different
handwriting&mdash;the handwriting of a man well educated but little
used to wielding the pen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other,&rdquo; mumbled Sir John.&nbsp; &ldquo;The other
man, by God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, with a smile that sat singularly on his withered face, he took
up a newspaper and went towards the fireplace, where he sat stiffly
in an armchair, taking an enormous interest in the morning&rsquo;s news.&nbsp;
He read a single piece of news three times over, and a fourth time in
a whisper, so as to rivet his attention upon it.&nbsp; He would not
admit that he was worsted&mdash;would not humble his pride even before
the ornaments on the mantelpiece.</p>
<p>Before Millicent came down, looking very fresh and pretty in her
tweed dress, the butler had sorted the letters.&nbsp; There were only
two upon her plate&mdash;the twin envelopes addressed by different hands.&nbsp;
Sir John was talking with a certain laboured lightness to Lady Cantourne,
when that lady&rsquo;s niece came into the room.&nbsp; He was watching
keenly.&nbsp; There was a certain amount of interest in the question
of those two envelopes, as to which she would open first.&nbsp; She
looked at each in turn, glanced furtively towards Sir John, made a suitable
reply to some remark addressed to her by the baron, and tore open Jack&rsquo;s
envelope.&nbsp; There was a gravity&mdash;a concentrated gravity&mdash;about
her lips as she unfolded the thin paper; and Sir John, who knew the
world and the little all-important trifles thereof, gave an impatient
sigh.&nbsp; It is the little trifle that betrays the man, and not the
larger issues of life in which we usually follow precedent.&nbsp; It
was that passing gravity (of the lips only) that told Sir John more
about Millicent Chyne than she herself knew, and what he had learnt
did not seem to be to his liking.</p>
<p>There is nothing so disquieting as the unknown motive, which disquietude
was Sir John&rsquo;s soon after breakfast.&nbsp; The other men dispersed
to put on gaiters and cartridge-bags, and the old aristocrat took his
newspaper on to the terrace.</p>
<p>Millicent followed him almost at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir John,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have had a letter from
Africa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Did she take it for granted that he knew this already?&nbsp; Was
this spontaneous?&nbsp; Had Jack told her to do it?</p>
<p>These questions flashed through the old man&rsquo;s mind as his eyes
rested on her pretty face.</p>
<p>He was beginning to be afraid of this girl: which showed his wisdom.&nbsp;
For the maiden beautiful is a stronger power in the world than the strong
man.&nbsp; The proof of which is that she gets her own way more often
than the strong man gets his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Africa?&rdquo; repeated Sir John Meredith, with a twitching
lip.&nbsp; &ldquo;And from whom is your letter, my dear young lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His face was quite still, his old eyes steady, as he waited for the
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John winced inwardly.&nbsp; Outwardly he smiled and folded his
newspaper upon his knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, from my brilliant son.&nbsp; That is interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you had one?&rdquo; she asked, in prompt payment of his
sarcasm.</p>
<p>Sir John Meredith looked up with a queer little smile.&nbsp; He admired
the girl&rsquo;s spirit.&nbsp; It was the smile of the fencer on touching
worthy steel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear young lady, I have not.&nbsp; Mr. John Meredith
does not find time to write to me&mdash;but he draws his allowance from
the bank with a filial regularity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Millicent had the letter in her hand.&nbsp; She made it crinkle in
her fingers within a foot of the old gentleman&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; A
faint odour of the scent she used reached his nostrils.&nbsp; He drew
back a little, as if he disliked it.&nbsp; His feeling for her almost
amounted to a repugnance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you might like to hear that he is well,&rdquo; she
said gently.&nbsp; She was reading the address on the envelope, and
again he saw that look of concentrated gravity which made him feel uneasy
for reasons of his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very kind of you to throw me even that crumb from your
richly-stored intellectual table.&nbsp; I am very glad to hear that
he is well.&nbsp; A whole long letter from him must be a treat indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought of a proverb relating to the grapes that are out of reach,
but said nothing.</p>
<p>It was the fashion that year to wear little flyaway jackets with
a coquettish pocket on each side.&nbsp; Millicent was wearing one of
them, and she now became aware that Sir John had glanced more than once
with a certain significance towards her left hand, which happened to
be in that pocket.&nbsp; It, moreover, happened that Guy Oscard&rsquo;s
letter was in the same receptacle.</p>
<p>She withdrew the hand and changed colour slightly as she became conscious
that the corner of the envelope was protruding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that by this time,&rdquo; said Sir John pleasantly,
&ldquo;you are quite an authority upon African matters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His manner was so extremely conversational and innocent that she
did not think it necessary to look for an inner meaning.&nbsp; She was
relieved to find that the two men, having actually met, spoke of each
other frankly.&nbsp; It was evident that Guy Oscard could be trusted
to keep his promise, and Jack Meredith was not the man to force or repose
a confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does not tell me much about Africa,&rdquo; she replied,
determined to hold her ground.&nbsp; She was engaged to be married to
Jack Meredith, and whether Sir John chose to ignore the fact or not
she did not mean to admit that the subject should be tabooed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I suppose he has plenty to tell you about himself
and his prospects?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he has.&nbsp; His prospects are not so hopeless as you
think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Miss Chyne,&rdquo; protested Sir John, &ldquo;I know
nothing about his prospects beyond the fact that, when I am removed
from this sphere of activity, he will come into possession of my title,
such as it is, and my means, such as they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you attach no importance to the work he is inaugurating
in Africa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the least.&nbsp; I did not even know that he was endeavouring
to work.&nbsp; I only trust it is not manual labour&mdash;it is so injurious
to the finger-nails.&nbsp; I have no sympathy with a gentleman who imagines
that manual labour is compatible with his position, provided that he
does not put his hand to the plough in England.&nbsp; Is not there something
in the Scriptures about a man putting his hand to the plough and looking
back?&nbsp; If Jack undertakes any work of that description, I trust
that he will recognise the fact that he forfeits his position by doing
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not manual labour&mdash;I can assure you of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear it.&nbsp; He probably sells printed cottons
to the natives, or exchanges wrought metal for ivory&mdash;an intellectual
craft.&nbsp; But he is gaining experience, and I suppose he thinks he
is going to make a fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It happened that this was precisely the thought expressed by Jack
Meredith in the letter in Millicent&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is sanguine,&rdquo; she admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&nbsp; Quite right.&nbsp; Pray do not discourage
him&mdash;if you find time to write.&nbsp; But between you and me, my
dear Miss Chyne, fortunes are not made in Africa.&nbsp; I am an old
man, and I have some experience of the world.&nbsp; That part of it
which is called Africa is not the place where fortunes are made.&nbsp;
It is as different from India as chalk is from cheese, if you will permit
so vulgar a simile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Millicent&rsquo;s face dropped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <i>some</i> people have made fortunes there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;in slaves!&nbsp; But that interesting commerce is
at an end.&nbsp; However, so long as my son does not suffer in health,
I suppose we must be thankful that he is creditably employed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;your amiable friend the baron
approaching with lawn-tennis necessaries.&nbsp; It is wonderful that
our neighbours never learn to keep their enthusiasm for lawn-tennis
in bounds until the afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he left her, and the baron came to the conclusion, before
very long, that something had &ldquo;contraried&rdquo; the charming
Miss Chyne.&nbsp; The truth was that Millicent was bitterly disappointed.&nbsp;
The idea of failure had never entered her head since Jack&rsquo;s letters,
full of life and energy, had begun to arrive.&nbsp; Sir John Meredith
was a man whose words commanded respect&mdash;partly because he was
an old man whose powers of perception had as yet apparently retained
their full force, and the vast experience of life which was his could
hardly be overrated.&nbsp; Man&rsquo;s prime is that period when the
widest experience and the keenest perception meet.</p>
<p>Millicent Chyne had lulled herself into a false security.&nbsp; She
had taken it for granted that Jack would succeed, and would return rich
and prosperous within a few months.&nbsp; Upon this pleasant certainty
Sir John had cast a doubt, and she could hardly treat his words with
contempt.&nbsp; She had almost forgotten Guy Oscard&rsquo;s letter.&nbsp;
Across a hemisphere Jack Meredith was a stronger influence in her life
than Oscard.</p>
<p>While she sat on the terrace and flirted with the baron she reflected
hurriedly over the situation.&nbsp; She was, she argued to herself,
not in any way engaged to Guy Oscard.&nbsp; If he in an unguarded moment
should dare to mention such a possibility to Jack, it would be quite
easy to contradict the statement with convincing heat.&nbsp; But in
her heart she was sure of Guy Oscard.&nbsp; One of the worst traits
in the character of an unfaithful woman is the readiness with which
she trades upon the faithfulness of men.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.&nbsp; UNDERHAND</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offender never pardons.</p>
<p>Victor Durnovo lingered on at Loango.&nbsp; He elaborated and detailed
to all interested, and to some whom it did not concern, many excuses
for his delay in returning to his expedition, lying supine and attendant
at Msala.&nbsp; It was by now an open secret on the coast that a great
trading expedition was about to ascend the Ogowe river, with, it was
whispered, a fortune awaiting it in the dim perspective of Central Africa.</p>
<p>Durnovo had already built up for himself a reputation.&nbsp; He was
known as one of the foremost ivory traders on the coast&mdash;a man
capable of standing against those enormous climatic risks before which
his competitors surely fell sooner or later.&nbsp; His knowledge of
the interior was unrivalled, his power over the natives a household
word.&nbsp; Great things were therefore expected, and Durnovo found
himself looked up to and respected in Loango with that friendly worship
which is only to be acquired by the possession or prospective possession
of vast wealth.</p>
<p>It is possible even in Loango to have a fling, but the carouser must
be prepared to face, even in the midst of his revelry, the haunting
thought that the exercise of the strictest economy in any other part
of the world might be a preferable pastime.</p>
<p>During the three days following his arrival Victor Durnovo indulged,
according to his lights, in the doubtful pleasure mentioned.&nbsp; He
purchased at the best factory the best clothes obtainable; he lived
like a fighting cock in the one so-called hotel&mdash;a house chiefly
affected and supported by ship-captains.&nbsp; He spent freely of money
that was not his, and imagined himself to be leading the life of a gentleman.&nbsp;
He rode round on a hired horse to call on his friends, and on the afternoon
of the sixth day he alighted from this quadruped at the gate of the
Gordons&rsquo; bungalow.</p>
<p>He knew that Maurice Gordon had left that morning on one of his frequent
visits to a neighbouring sub-factory.&nbsp; Nevertheless, he expressed
surprise when the servant gave him the information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Gordon,&rdquo; he said, tapping his boot with a riding-whip:
&ldquo;is she in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later Jocelyn came into the drawing-room, where he
was waiting with a brazen face and a sinking heart.&nbsp; Somehow the
very room had power to bring him down towards his own level.&nbsp; When
he set eyes on Jocelyn, in her fair Saxon beauty, he regained <i>aplomb</i>.</p>
<p>She appeared to be rather glad to see him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you had gone back
to the expedition?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Victor Durnovo&rsquo;s boundless conceit substituted &ldquo;feared&rdquo;
for &ldquo;thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not without coming to say good-bye,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is not likely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just to demonstrate how fully he felt at ease, he took a chair without
waiting for an invitation, and sat tapping his boot with his whip, looking
her furtively up and down all the while with an appraising eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when do you go?&rdquo; she asked, with a subtle change
in her tone which did not penetrate his mental epidermis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose in a few days now; but I&rsquo;ll let you know all
right, never fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victor Durnovo stretched out his legs and made himself quite at home;
but Jocelyn did not sit down.&nbsp; On the contrary, she remained standing,
persistently and significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maurice gone away?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And left you all alone,&rdquo; in a tone of light badinage,
which fell rather flat, on stony ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am accustomed to being left,&rdquo; she answered gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite like it, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him with a steady surprise which made him feel a trifle
uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know,&rdquo; he was forced to explain, shuffling
the while uneasily in his chair and dropping his whip, &ldquo;one naturally
takes an interest in one&rsquo;s friends&rsquo; welfare.&nbsp; You and
Maurice are the best friends I have in Loango.&nbsp; I often speak to
Maurice about it.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t as if there was an English garrison,
or anything like that.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t trust these niggers a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you do not understand them?&rdquo; suggested she gently.</p>
<p>She moved away from him as far as she could get.&nbsp; Every moment
increased her repugnance for his presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Maurice would endorse that,&rdquo; he
said, with a conceited laugh.</p>
<p>She winced at the familiar mention of her brother&rsquo;s name, which
was probably intentional, and her old fear of this man came back with
renewed force.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that Maurice&rsquo;s
estimation of my humble self is quite so low as yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave a nervous little laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maurice has always spoken of you with gratitude,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To deaf ears, eh?&nbsp; Yes, he has reason to be grateful,
though perhaps I ought not to say it.&nbsp; I have put him into several
very good things on the coast, and it is in my power to get him into
this new scheme.&nbsp; It is a big thing; he would be a rich man in
no time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose from his seat and deliberately crossed the room to the sofa
where she had sat down, where he reclined, with one arm stretched out
along the back of it towards her.&nbsp; In his other hand he held his
riding-whip, with which he began to stroke the skirt of her dress, which
reached along the floor almost to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like him to be in it?&rdquo; he asked, with a meaning
glance beneath his lashes.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a pity to throw away a
good chance; his position is not so very secure, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave a strange little hunted glance round the room.&nbsp; She
was wedged into a corner, and could not rise without incurring the risk
of his saying something she did not wish to hear.&nbsp; Then she leant
forward and deliberately withdrew her dress from the touch of his whip,
which was in its way a subtle caress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he throwing away the chance?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she rose from her seat, and, standing in the middle of the room,
faced him with a sudden gleam in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not see what it has to do with me,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I
do not know anything about Maurice&rsquo;s business arrangements, and
very little about his business friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let me tell you, Jocelyn&mdash;well, then, Miss Gordon,
if you prefer it&mdash;that you will know more about one of his business
friends before you have finished with him.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got Maurice
more or less in my power now, and it rests with you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment a shadow darkened the floor of the verandah, and an
instant later Jack Meredith walked quietly in by the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enter, young man,&rdquo; he said dramatically, &ldquo;by window&mdash;centre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he went on in a different tone to Jocelyn,
&ldquo;to come in this unceremonious way, but the servant told me that
you were in the verandah with Durnovo and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned towards the half-breed, pausing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Durnovo is the man I want,&rdquo; weighing on each word.</p>
<p>Durnovo&rsquo;s right hand was in his jacket pocket.&nbsp; Seeing
Meredith&rsquo;s proffered salutation, he slowly withdrew it and shook
hands.</p>
<p>The flash of hatred was still in his eyes when Jack Meredith turned
upon him with aggravating courtesy.&nbsp; The pleasant, half-cynical
glance wandered from Durnovo&rsquo;s dark face very deliberately down
to his jacket pocket, where the stock of a revolver was imperfectly
concealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were getting anxious about you,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;seeing
that you did not come back.&nbsp; Of course, we knew that you were capable
of taking&mdash;care&mdash;of yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was still looking innocently at the tell-tale jacket pocket, and
Durnovo, following the direction of his glance, hastily thrust his hand
into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But one can never tell, with a treacherous climate like this,
what a day may bring forth.&nbsp; However, I am glad to find you looking&mdash;so
very fit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victor Durnovo gave an awkward little laugh, extremely conscious
of the factory clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
was going to start this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl stood behind them, with a flush slowly fading from her face.&nbsp;
There are some women who become suddenly beautiful&mdash;not by the
glory of a beautiful thought, not by the exaltation of a lofty virtue,
but by the mere practical human flush.&nbsp; Jack Meredith, when he
took his eyes from Durnovo&rsquo;s, glancing at Jocelyn, suddenly became
aware of the presence of a beautiful woman.</p>
<p>The crisis was past; and if Jack knew it, so also did Jocelyn.&nbsp;
She knew that the imperturbable gentlemanliness of the Englishman had
conveyed to the more passionate West Indian the simple, downright fact
that in a lady&rsquo;s drawing-room there was to be no raised voice,
no itching fingers, no flash of fiery eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that will suit me splendidly.&nbsp;
We will travel together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to Jocelyn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear your brother is away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, for a few days.&nbsp; He has gone up the coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then there was a silence.&nbsp; They both paused, helping each other
as if by pre-arrangement, and Victor Durnovo suddenly felt that he must
go.&nbsp; He rose, and picked up the whip which he had dropped on the
matting.&nbsp; There was no help for it&mdash;the united wills of these
two people were too strong for him.</p>
<p>Jack Meredith passed out of the verandah with him, murmuring something
about giving him a leg up.&nbsp; While they were walking round the house,
Victor Durnovo made one of those hideous mistakes which one remembers
all through life with a sudden rush of warm shame and self-contempt.&nbsp;
The very thing that was uppermost in his mind to be avoided suddenly
bubbled to his lips, almost, it would seem, in defiance of his own will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the small&mdash;the small-pox?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have got it under,&rdquo; replied Jack quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
had a very bad time for three days, but we got all the cases isolated
and prevented it from spreading.&nbsp; Of course, we could do little
or nothing to save them; they died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Durnovo had the air of a whipped dog.&nbsp; His mind was a blank.&nbsp;
He simply had nothing to say; the humiliation of utter self-contempt
was his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not be afraid to come back now,&rdquo; Jack Meredith
went on, with a strange refinement of cruelty.</p>
<p>And that was all he ever said about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will it be convenient for you to meet me on the beach at four
o&rsquo;clock this afternoon?&rdquo; he asked, when Durnovo was in the
saddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right&mdash;four o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned and deliberately went back to the bungalow.</p>
<p>There are some friendships where the intercourse is only the seed
which absence duly germinates.&nbsp; Jocelyn Gordon and Jack had parted
as acquaintances; they met as friends.&nbsp; There is no explaining
these things, for there is no gauging the depths of the human mind.&nbsp;
There is no getting down to the little bond that lies at the bottom
of the well&mdash;the bond of sympathy.&nbsp; There is no knowing what
it is that prompts us to say, &ldquo;This man, or this woman, of all
the millions, shall be my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that he should have had
a chance of causing you uneasiness again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jocelyn remembered that all her life.&nbsp; She remembers still&mdash;and
Africa has slipped away from her existence for ever.&nbsp; It is one
of the mental photographs of her memory, standing out clear and strong
amidst a host of minor recollections.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.&nbsp; A REQUEST</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>It surely was my profit had I known<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
would have been my pleasure had I seen.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did he come back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jocelyn had risen as if to intimate that, if he cared to do so, they
would sit in the verandah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did Mr. Durnovo come back?&rdquo; she repeated; for Jack
did not seem to have heard the question.&nbsp; He was drawing forward
a cane chair with the leisurely <i>d&eacute;bonnair</i> grace that was
his, and, before replying, he considered for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To get quinine,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>Without looking at her, he seemed to divine that he had made a mistake.&nbsp;
He seemed to know that she had flushed suddenly to the roots of her
hair, with a distressed look in her eyes.&nbsp; The reason was too trivial.&nbsp;
She could only draw one conclusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;to tell you the truth, I think
his nerve gave way a little.&nbsp; His health is undermined by this
climate.&nbsp; He has been too long in Africa.&nbsp; We have had a bad
time at Msala.&nbsp; We have had small-pox in the camp.&nbsp; Oscard
and I have been doing doughty deeds.&nbsp; I feel convinced that, if
we applied to some Society, we should get something or other&mdash;a
testimonial or a monument&mdash;also Joseph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like Joseph,&rdquo; she said in a low tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I.&nbsp; If circumstances had been different&mdash;if
Joseph had not been my domestic servant&mdash;I should have liked him
for a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was looking straight in front of him with a singular fixity.&nbsp;
It is possible that he was conscious of the sidelong scrutiny which
he was undergoing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&mdash;you have been all right?&rdquo; she said lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; with a laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have not brought
the infection down to Loango; you need not be afraid of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment she looked as if she were going to explain that she
was not &ldquo;afraid of that.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she changed her mind
and let it pass, as he seemed to believe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joseph constructed a disinfecting room with a wood-smoke fire,
or something of that description, and he has been disinfecting everything,
down to Oscard&rsquo;s pipes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave a little laugh, which stopped suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it very bad?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no.&nbsp; We took it in time, you see.&nbsp; We had eleven
deaths.&nbsp; And now we are all right.&nbsp; We are only waiting for
Durnovo to join, and then we shall make a start.&nbsp; Of course, somebody
else could have come down for the quinine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glanced at her beneath his lashes before going on,</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, as Durnovo&rsquo;s nerves were a little shaken, it&mdash;was
just as well, don&rsquo;t you know, to get him out of it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he got himself out of it all?&rdquo; she said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;to a certain extent.&nbsp; With our approval, you
understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Men have an <i>esprit de sexe</i> as well as women.&nbsp; They like
to hustle the cowards through with the crowd, unobserved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a strange thing,&rdquo; said Jocelyn, with a woman&rsquo;s
scorn of the man who fears those things of which she herself has no
sort of dread, &ldquo;a very strange thing, that Mr. Durnovo said nothing
about it down here.&nbsp; It is not known in Loango that you had small-pox
in the camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, when he left we were not quite sure about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine Mr. Durnovo knows all about small-pox.&nbsp; We
all do on this coast.&nbsp; He could hardly help recognising it in its
earliest stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned on him with a smile which he remembered afterwards.&nbsp;
At the moment he felt rather abashed, as if he had been caught in a
very maze of untruths.&nbsp; He did not meet her eyes.&nbsp; It was
a matter of pride with him that he was equal to any social emergency
that might arise.&nbsp; He had always deemed himself capable of withholding
from the whole questioning world anything that he might wish to withhold.&nbsp;
But afterwards&mdash;later in his life&mdash;he remembered that look
in Jocelyn Gordon&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Altogether,&rdquo; she said, with a peculiar little contented
laugh, &ldquo;I think you cannot keep it up any longer.&nbsp; He ran
away from you and left you to fight against it alone.&nbsp; All the
same, it was&mdash;nice&mdash;of you to try and screen him.&nbsp; Very
nice, but I do not think that I could have done it myself.&nbsp; I suppose
it was&mdash;noble&mdash;and women cannot be noble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it was only expedient.&nbsp; The best way to take the
world is to wring it dry&mdash;not to try and convert it and make it
better, but to turn its vices to account.&nbsp; That method has the
double advantage of serving one&rsquo;s purpose at the time, and standing
as a warning later.&nbsp; The best way to cure vice is to turn it ruthlessly
to one&rsquo;s own account.&nbsp; That is what we are doing with Durnovo.&nbsp;
His little idiosyncrasies will turn in witness against him later on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head in disbelief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your practice and your theory do not agree,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>There was a little pause; then she turned to him gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been vaccinated?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the days of my baptism, wherein I was made&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; she interrupted impatiently, &ldquo;but since?&nbsp;
Have you had it done lately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just before I came away from England.&nbsp; My tailor urged
it so strongly.&nbsp; He said that he had made outfits for many gents
going to Africa, and they had all made their wills and been vaccinated.&nbsp;
For reasons which are too painful to dwell upon in these pages I could
not make a will, so I was enthusiastically vaccinated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And have you all the medicines you will require?&nbsp; Did
you really want that quinine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a practical, common-sense anxiety in the way she asked
these questions which made him answer gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All, thanks.&nbsp; We did not really want the quinine, but
we can do with it.&nbsp; Oscard is our doctor; he is really very good.&nbsp;
He looks it all up in a book, puts all the negative symptoms on one
side, and the positive on the other&mdash;adds them all up, then deducts
the smaller from the larger, and treats what is left of the patient
accordingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed, more with the view of pleasing him than from a real
sense of the ludicrous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not believe,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you know the
risks you are running into.&nbsp; Even in the short time that Maurice
and I have been here we have learnt to treat the climate of Western
Africa with a proper respect.&nbsp; We have known so many people who
have&mdash;succumbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I do not mean to do that.&nbsp; In a way, Durnovo&rsquo;s&mdash;what
shall we call it?&mdash;lack of nerve is a great safeguard.&nbsp; He
will not run into any danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but he might run you into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a second time, Miss Gordon.&nbsp; Not if we know it.&nbsp;
Oscard mentioned a desire to wring Durnovo&rsquo;s neck.&nbsp; I am
afraid he will do it one of these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mistake that most people make,&rdquo; the girl went on
more lightly, &ldquo;is a want of care.&nbsp; You cannot be too careful,
you know, in Africa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am careful; I have reason to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was looking at him steadily, her blue eyes searching his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; she said slowly, and there were a thousand questions
in the word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be very foolish of me to be otherwise,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am engaged to be married, and I came out here to
make the wherewithal.&nbsp; This expedition is an expedition to seek
the wherewithal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and therefore you must be more
careful than any one else.&nbsp; Because, you see, your life is something
which does not belong to you, but with which you are trusted.&nbsp;
I mean, if there is anything dangerous to be done, let some one else
do it.&nbsp; What is she like?&nbsp; What is her name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her name is Millicent&mdash;Millicent Chyne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;what is she like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leant back, and, interlocking his fingers, stretched his arms
out with the palms of his hands outward&mdash;a habit of his when asked
a question needing consideration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is of medium height; her hair is brown.&nbsp; Her worst
enemy admits, I believe, that she is pretty.&nbsp; Of course, I am convinced
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Jocelyn steadily.&nbsp; &ldquo;That
is as it should be.&nbsp; And I have no doubt that you and her worst
enemy are both quite right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded cheerfully, indicating a great faith in his own judgment
on the matter under discussion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I have not a photograph.&nbsp;
That would be the correct thing, would it not?&nbsp; I ought to have
one always with me in a locket round my neck, or somewhere.&nbsp; A
curiously-wrought locket is the correct thing, I believe.&nbsp; People
in books usually carry something of that description&mdash;and it is
always curiously wrought.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know where they buy them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think they are usually inherited,&rdquo; suggested Jocelyn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose they are,&rdquo; he went on in the same semi-serious
tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;And then I ought to have it always ready to clasp
in my dying hand, where Joseph would find it and wipe away a furtive
tear as he buried me.&nbsp; It is a pity.&nbsp; I am afraid I inherited
nothing from my ancestors except a very practical mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have liked very much to see a photograph of Miss
Chyne,&rdquo; said Jocelyn, who had, apparently, not been listening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope some day you will see herself, at home in England.&nbsp;
For you have no abiding city here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a few more years now.&nbsp; Has she&mdash;are her parents
living?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they are both dead.&nbsp; Indian people they were.&nbsp;
Indian people have a tragic way of dying young.&nbsp; Millicent lives
with her aunt, Lady Cantourne.&nbsp; And Lady Cantourne ought to have
married my respected father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did she not do so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders&mdash;paused&mdash;sat up and flicked a
large moth off the arm of his chair.&nbsp; Then,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness only knows,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Goodness,
and themselves.&nbsp; I suppose they found it out too late.&nbsp; That
is one of the little risks of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She answered nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that there will be
a special Hell in the Hereafter for parents who have sacrificed their
children&rsquo;s lives to their own ambition?&nbsp; I hope there will
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never given the matter the consideration it deserves,&rdquo;
she answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Was that the reason?&nbsp; Is Lady Cantourne
a more important person than Lady Meredith?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave a little nod of comprehension, as if he had raised a curtain
for her to see into his life&mdash;into the far perspective of it, reaching
back into the dim distance of fifty years before.&nbsp; For our lives
do reach back into the lives of our fathers and grandfathers; the beginnings
made there come down into our daily existence, shaping our thought and
action.&nbsp; That which stood between Sir John Meredith and his son
was not so much the present personality of Millicent Chyne as the past
shadows of a disappointed life, an unloved wife and an unsympathetic
mother.&nbsp; And these things Jocelyn Gordon knew while she sat, gazing
with thoughtful eyes, wherein something lived and burned of which she
was almost ignorant&mdash;gazing through the tendrils of the creeping
flowers that hung around them.</p>
<p>At last Jack Meredith rose briskly, watch in hand, and Jocelyn came
back to things of earth with a quick gasping sigh which took her by
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Gordon, will you do something for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tore a leaf from his pocket-book, and, going to the table, he
wrote on the paper with a pencil pendent at his watch-chain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last few days,&rdquo; he explained while he wrote, &ldquo;have
awakened me to the lamentable fact that human life is rather an uncertain
affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came towards her, holding out the paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you hear&mdash;if anything happens to me, would you be
so kind as to write to Millicent and tell her of it?&nbsp; That is the
address.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took the paper, and read the address with a dull sort of interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, if you like.&nbsp;
But&mdash;nothing must happen to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a slight unsteadiness in her voice, which made her stop
suddenly.&nbsp; She did not fold the paper, but continued to read the
address.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;nothing will.&nbsp; But would you
not despise a man who could not screw up his courage to face the possibility?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wondered what she was thinking about, for she did not seem to
hear him.</p>
<p>A clock in the drawing-room behind them struck the half-hour, and
the sound seemed to recall her to the present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going now?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, vaguely puzzled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,
I must go now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose, and for a moment he held her hand.&nbsp; He was distinctly
conscious of something left unsaid&mdash;of many things.&nbsp; He even
paused on the edge of the verandah, trying to think what it was that
he had to say.&nbsp; Then he pushed aside the hanging flowers and passed
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; he said over his shoulder.</p>
<p>Her lips moved, but he heard no sound.&nbsp; She turned with a white,
drawn face and sat down again.&nbsp; The paper was still in her hand.&nbsp;
She consulted it again, reading in a whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Millicent Chyne&mdash;Millicent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned the paper over and studied the back of it&mdash;almost
as if she was trying to find what there was behind that name.</p>
<p>Through the trees there rose and fell the music of the distant surf.&nbsp;
Somewhere near at hand a water-wheel, slowly irrigating the rice-fields,
creaked and groaned after the manner of water-wheels all over Africa.&nbsp;
In all there was that subtle sense of unreality&mdash;that utter lack
of permanency which touches the heart of the white exile in tropic lands,
and lets life slip away without allowing the reality of it to be felt.</p>
<p>The girl sat there with the name before her&mdash;written on the
little slip of paper&mdash;the only memento he had left her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.&nbsp; IVORY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>&rsquo;Tis one thing to be tempted,
Escalus,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing to fall.</i></p>
<p>One of the peculiarities of Africa yet to be explained is the almost
supernatural rapidity with which rumour travels.&nbsp; Across the whole
breadth of this darkest continent a mere bit of gossip has made its
way in a month.&nbsp; A man may divulge a secret, say, at St. Paul de
Loanda, take ship to Zanzibar, and there his own secret will be told
to him.</p>
<p>Rumour met Maurice Gordon almost at the outset of his journey northward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Small-pox is raging on the Ogowe River,&rdquo; they told him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The English expedition is stricken down with it.&nbsp; The three
leaders are dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maurice Gordon had not lived four years on the West African coast
in vain.&nbsp; He took this for what it was worth.&nbsp; But if he had
acquired scepticism, he had lost his nerve.&nbsp; He put about and sailed
back to Loango.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he muttered, as he walked up from the beach
to his office that same afternoon&mdash;&ldquo;I wonder if Durnovo is
among them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he was conscious of a ray of hope in his mind.&nbsp; He was a
kind-hearted man, in his way, this Maurice Gordon of Loango; but he
could not disguise from himself the simple fact that the death of Victor
Durnovo would be a distinct convenience and a most desirable relief.&nbsp;
Even the best of us&mdash;that is to say, the present writer and his
reader&mdash;have these inconvenient little feelings.&nbsp; There are
people who have done us no particular injury, to whom we wish no particular
harm, but we feel that it would be very expedient and considerate of
them to die.</p>
<p>Thinking these thoughts, Maurice Gordon arrived at the factory and
went straight to his own office, where he found the object of them&mdash;Victor
Durnovo&mdash;sitting in consumption of the office sherry.</p>
<p>Gordon saw at once that the rumour was true.&nbsp; There was a hunted
unwholesome look in Durnovo&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; He looked shaken, and
failed to convey a suggestion of personal dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hulloa!&rdquo; exclaimed the proprietor of the decanter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You look a bit chippy.&nbsp; I have been told there is small-pox
up at Msala.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So have I.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve just heard it from Meredith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just heard it&mdash;is Meredith down here too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and the fool wants to go back to-night.&nbsp; I have
to meet him on the beach at four o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maurice Gordon sat down, poured out for himself a glass of sherry,
and drank it thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Durnovo,&rdquo; he said emphatically, &ldquo;I
have my doubts about Meredith being a fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; with a derisive laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maurice Gordon looked over his shoulder to see that the door was
shut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to be very careful,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The least slip might let it all out.&nbsp; Meredith has a quiet
way of looking at one which disquiets me.&nbsp; He might find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not he,&rdquo; replied Durnovo confidently, &ldquo;especially
if we succeed; and we shall succeed&mdash;by God we shall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maurice Gordon made a little movement of the shoulders, as indicating
a certain uneasiness, but he said nothing.</p>
<p>There was a pause of considerable duration, at the end of which Durnovo
produced a paper from his pocket and threw it down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good business,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two thousand tusks,&rdquo; murmured Maurice Gordon.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s good.&nbsp; Through Akmed, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; We can outdo these Arabs at their own trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An evil smile lighted up Durnovo&rsquo;s sallow face.&nbsp; When
he smiled, his dropping, curtain-like moustache projected in a way that
made keen observers of the human face wonder what his mouth was like.</p>
<p>Gordon, who had been handling the paper with the tips of his finger,
as if it were something unclean, threw it down on the table again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&mdash;es,&rdquo; he said slowly; &ldquo;but it does not
seem to dirty black hands as it does white.&nbsp; They know no better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord!&rdquo; ejaculated Durnovo.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
let us begin the old arguments all over again.&nbsp; I thought we settled
that the trade was there; we couldn&rsquo;t prevent it, and therefore
the best thing is to make hay while the sun shines, and then clear out
of the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose Meredith finds out?&rdquo; reiterated Maurice
Gordon, with a lamentable hesitation that precedes loss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Meredith finds out, it will be the worse for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A certain concentration of tone aroused Maurice Gordon&rsquo;s attention,
and he glanced uneasily at his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one knows what goes on in the heart of Africa,&rdquo; said
Durnovo darkly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But we will not trouble about that; Meredith
won&rsquo;t find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With your sister, at the bungalow.&nbsp; A lady&rsquo;s man&mdash;that
is what he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victor Durnovo was smarting under a sense of injury which was annoyingly
indefinite.&nbsp; It was true that Jack Meredith had come at a very
unpropitious moment; but it was equally clear that the intrusion could
only have been the result of accident.&nbsp; It was really a case of
the third person who is no company, with aggravated symptoms.&nbsp;
Durnovo had vaguely felt in the presence of either a subtle possibility
of sympathy between Jocelyn Gordon and Jack Meredith.&nbsp; When he
saw them together, for only a few minutes as it happened, the sympathy
rose up and buffeted him in the face, and he hated Jack Meredith for
it.&nbsp; He hated him for a certain reposeful sense of capability which
he had at first set down as conceit, and later on had learnt to value
as something innate in blood and education which was not conceit.&nbsp;
He hated him because his gentlemanliness was so obvious that it showed
up the flaws in other men, as the masterpiece upon the wall shows up
the weaknesses of the surrounding pictures.&nbsp; But most of all he
hated him because Jocelyn Gordon seemed to have something in common
with the son of Sir John Meredith&mdash;a world above the head of even
the most successful trader on the coast&mdash;a world in which he, Victor
Durnovo, could never live and move at ease.</p>
<p>Beyond this, Victor Durnovo cherished the hatred of the Found Out.&nbsp;
He felt instinctively that behind the courteous demeanour of Jack Meredith
there was an opinion&mdash;a cool, unbiassed criticism&mdash;of himself,
which Meredith had no intention of divulging.</p>
<p>On hearing that Jack was at the bungalow with Jocelyn, Maurice Gordon
glanced at the clock and wondered how he could get away from his present
visitor.&nbsp; The atmosphere of Jack Meredith&rsquo;s presence was
preferable to that diffused by Victor Durnovo.&nbsp; There was a feeling
of personal safety and dignity in the very sound of his voice which
set a weak and easily-led man upon his feet.</p>
<p>But Victor Durnovo had something to say to Gordon which circumstances
had brought to a crisis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, leaning forward and throwing away
the cigarette he had been smoking.&nbsp; &ldquo;This Simiacine scheme
is going to be the biggest thing that has ever been run on this coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Gordon, with the indifference that comes
from non-participation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m the only business man in it,&rdquo; significantly.</p>
<p>Gordon nodded his head, awaiting further developments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which means that I could work another man into it.&nbsp; I
might find out that we could not get on without him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The black eyes seemed to probe the good-natured, sensual face of
Maurice Gordon, so keen, so searching was their glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I would be willing to do it&mdash;to make that man&rsquo;s
fortune&mdash;provided&mdash;that he was&mdash;my brother-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil do you mean?&rdquo; asked Gordon, setting down
the glass that was half raised to his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that I want to marry&mdash;Jocelyn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the modern school of realistic, mawkishly foul novelists, who
hold that Love excuseth all, would have taken delight in the passionate
rendering of the girl&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to marry Jocelyn, do you?&rdquo; answered Maurice, with
a derisive little laugh.&nbsp; On the first impulse of the moment he
gave no thought to himself or his own interests, and spoke with undisguised
contempt.&nbsp; He might have been speaking to a beggar on the roadside.</p>
<p>Durnovo&rsquo;s eyes flashed dangerously, and his tobacco-stained
teeth clenched for a moment over his lower lip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is my desire&mdash;and intention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Durnovo!&rdquo; exclaimed Gordon.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
be a fool!&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you see that it is quite out of the question?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He attempted weakly to dismiss the matter by leaning forward on his
writing-table, taking up his pen, and busying himself with a number
of papers.</p>
<p>Victor Durnovo rose from his chair so hastily that in a flash Maurice
Gordon&rsquo;s hand was in the top right-hand drawer of his writing-table.&nbsp;
The good-natured blue eyes suddenly became fixed and steady.&nbsp; But
Durnovo seemed to make an effort over himself, and walked to the window,
where he drew aside the woven-grass blind and looked out into the glaring
sunlight.&nbsp; Still standing there, he turned and spoke in a low,
concentrated voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see that it is out
of the question.&nbsp; On the contrary, it seems only natural that she
should marry the man who is her brother&rsquo;s partner in many a little&mdash;speculation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maurice Gordon, sitting there, staring hopelessly into the half-breed&rsquo;s
yellow face, saw it all.&nbsp; He went back in a flash of recollection
to many passing details which had been unnoted at the time&mdash;details
which now fitted into each other like the links of a chain&mdash;and
that chain was around him.&nbsp; He leapt forward in a momentary opening
of the future, and saw himself ruined, disgraced, held up to the execration
of the whole civilised world.&nbsp; He was utterly in this man&rsquo;s
power&mdash;bound hand and foot.&nbsp; He could not say him no.&nbsp;
And least of all could he say no to this demand, which had roused all
the latent chivalry, gentlemanliness, brotherly love, that was in him.&nbsp;
Maurice Gordon knew that Victor Durnovo possessed knowledge which Jocelyn
would consider cheap at the price of her person.</p>
<p>There was one way out of it.&nbsp; His hand was still on the handle
of the top right-hand drawer.&nbsp; He was a dead shot.&nbsp; His finger
was within two inches of the stock of a revolver.&nbsp; One bullet for
Victor Durnovo, another for himself.&nbsp; Then the old training of
his school days&mdash;the training that makes an upright, honest gentleman&mdash;asserted
itself, and he saw the cowardice of it.&nbsp; There was time enough
for that later, when the crisis came.&nbsp; In the meantime, if the
worst came to the worst, he could fight to the end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; said Durnovo, who seemed to be
following Gordon&rsquo;s thoughts, &ldquo;that the idea would be so
repellent to your sister as you seem to think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And a sudden ray of hope shot athwart the future into which his listener
was staring.&nbsp; It might be so.&nbsp; One can never tell with women.&nbsp;
Maurice Gordon had had considerable experience of the world, and, after
all, he was only building up hope upon precedent.&nbsp; He knew, as
well as you or I, that women will dance and flirt with&mdash;even marry&mdash;men
who are not gentlemen.&nbsp; Not only for the moment, but as a permanency,
something seems to kill their perception of a fact which is patent to
every educated man in the room; and one never knows what it is.&nbsp;
One can only surmise that it is that thirst for admiration which does
more harm in the world than the thirst for alcoholic stimulant which
we fight with societies and guilds, oaths and little snips of ribbon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idea never entered my head,&rdquo; said Gordon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has never been out of mine,&rdquo; replied Durnovo, with
a little harsh laugh which was almost pathetic.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want you to do anything now,&rdquo; he went on more gently.&nbsp; It
was wonderful how well he knew Maurice Gordon.&nbsp; The suggested delay
appealed to one side of his nature, the softened tone to another.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is time enough.&nbsp; When I come back I will speak of
it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have not spoken to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I have not spoken to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maurice Gordon shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a queer girl,&rdquo; he said, trying to conceal the
hope that was in his voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;She is cleverer than me, you
know, and all that.&nbsp; My influence is very small, and would scarcely
be considered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your interests would,&rdquo; suggested Durnovo.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Your sister is very fond of you, and&mdash;I think I have one
or two arguments to put forward which she would recognise as uncommonly
strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colour which had been returning slowly to Maurice Gordon&rsquo;s
face now faded away again.&nbsp; His lips were dry and shrivelled as
if he had passed through a sirocco.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind,&rdquo; continued Durnovo reassuringly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
say I would use them unless I suspected that you were acting in opposition
to my wishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gordon said nothing.&nbsp; His heart was throbbing uncomfortably&mdash;it
seemed to be in his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would not bring forward those arguments except as a last
resource,&rdquo; went on Victor Durnovo, with the deliberate cruelty
of a tyrant.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would first point out the advantages; a
fourth share in the Simiacine scheme would make you a rich man&mdash;above
suspicion&mdash;independent of the gossip of the market-place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maurice Gordon winced visibly, and his eyes wavered as if he were
about to give way to panic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could retire and go home to England&mdash;to a cooler
climate.&nbsp; This country might get too hot for your constitution&mdash;see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Durnovo came back into the centre of the room and stood by the writing-table.&nbsp;
His attitude was that of a man holding a whip over a cowering dog.</p>
<p>He took up his hat and riding-whip with a satisfied little laugh,
as if the dog had cringingly done his bidding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; he said, with a certain defiance of manner,
&ldquo;I may succeed without any of that&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Gordon was obliged to admit with a gulp, as if
he were swallowing his pride, and he knew that in saying the word he
was degrading his sister&mdash;throwing her at this man&rsquo;s feet
as the price of his honour.</p>
<p>With a half-contemptuous nod Victor Durnovo turned, and went away
to keep his appointment with Meredith.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.&nbsp; BROUGHT TO THE SCRATCH</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Take heed of still waters; they
quick pass away.</i></p>
<p>Guy Oscard was sitting on the natural terrace in front of Durnovo&rsquo;s
house at Msala, and Marie attended to his simple wants with that patient
dignity which suggested the recollection of better times, and appealed
strongly to the manhood of her fellow-servant Joseph.</p>
<p>Oscard was not good at the enunciation of those small amenities which
are supposed to soothe the feelings of the temporarily debased.&nbsp;
He vaguely felt that this woman was not accustomed to menial service,
but he knew that any suggestion of sympathy was more than he could compass.&nbsp;
So he merely spoke to her more gently than to the men, and perhaps she
understood, despite her chocolate-coloured skin.</p>
<p>They had inaugurated a strange, unequal friendship during the three
days that Oscard had been left alone at Msala.&nbsp; Joseph had been
promoted to the command of a certain number of the porters, and his
domestic duties were laid aside.&nbsp; Thus Marie was called upon to
attend to Guy Oscard&rsquo;s daily wants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll take coffee,&rdquo; he was saying to her
in reply to a question.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes&mdash;coffee, please, Marie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was smoking one of his big wooden pipes, staring straight in front
of him with a placidity natural to his bulk.</p>
<p>The woman turned away with a little smile.&nbsp; She liked this big
man with his halting tongue and quiet ways.&nbsp; She liked his awkward
attempts to conciliate the coquette Xantippe&mdash;to extract a smile
from the grave Nestorius, and she liked his manner towards herself.&nbsp;
She liked the poised pipe and the jerky voice as he said, &ldquo;Yes&mdash;coffee,
please, Marie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Women do like these things&mdash;they seem to understand them and
to attach some strange, subtle importance of their own to them.&nbsp;
For which power some of us who have not the knack of turning a pretty
phrase or throwing off an appropriate pleasantry may well be thankful.</p>
<p>Presently she returned, bringing the coffee on a rough tray, also
a box of matches and Oscard&rsquo;s tobacco pouch.&nbsp; Noting this
gratuitous attention to his comfort, he looked up with a little laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er&mdash;thank you,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not put his pipe back to his lips&mdash;keenly alive to the
fact that the exigency of the moment demanded a little polite exchange
of commonplace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Children gone to bed?&rdquo; he asked anxiously.</p>
<p>She paused in her slow, deft arrangement of the little table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>He nodded as if the news were eminently satisfactory.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nestorius,&rdquo;
he said, adhering to Meredith&rsquo;s pleasantry, &ldquo;is the jolliest
little chap I have met for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered softly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes&mdash;but
listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He raised his head, listening as she did&mdash;both looking down
the river into the gathering darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear the sound of paddles,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&nbsp; My ears are not so sharp as yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am accustomed to it,&rdquo; the woman said, with some emotion
in her voice which he did not understand then.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am always
listening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oscard seemed to be struck with this description of herself.&nbsp;
It was so very apt&mdash;so comprehensive.&nbsp; The woman&rsquo;s attitude
before the world was the attitude of the listener for some distant sound.</p>
<p>She poured out his coffee, setting the cup at his elbow.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now
you will hear,&rdquo; she said, standing upright with that untrammelled
dignity of carriage which is found wherever African blood is in the
veins.&nbsp; &ldquo;They have just come round Broken Tree Bend.&nbsp;
There are two boats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He listened, and after a moment heard the regular glug-glug of the
paddles stealing over the waters of the still tropic river, covering
a wonderful distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I hear.&nbsp; Mr. Meredith said
he would be back to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave a strange, little low laugh&mdash;almost the laugh of a
happy woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is like that, Mr. Meredith,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;what
he says he does&rdquo;&mdash;in the pretty English of one who has learnt
Spanish first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Marie&mdash;he is like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned, in her strangely subdued way, and went into the house
to prepare some supper for the new-comers.</p>
<p>It was not long before the sound of the paddles was quite distinct,
and then&mdash;probably on turning a corner of the river and coming
in sight of the lights of Msala&mdash;Jack Meredith&rsquo;s cheery shout
came floating through the night.&nbsp; Oscard took his pipe from his
lips and sent back an answer that echoed against the trees across the
river.&nbsp; He walked down to the water&rsquo;s edge, where he was
presently joined by Joseph with a lantern.</p>
<p>The two boats came on to the sloping shore with a grating sound,
and by the light of the waving lantern Oscard saw Durnovo and Jack land
from the same boat.</p>
<p>The three men walked up to the house together.&nbsp; Marie was at
the door, and bowed her head gravely in answer to Jack&rsquo;s salutation.&nbsp;
Durnovo nodded curtly and said nothing.</p>
<p>In the sitting-room, by the light of the paraffin lamp, the two Englishmen
exchanged a long questioning glance, quite different from the quick
interrogation of a woman&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; There was a smile on Jack
Meredith&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All ready to start to-morrow?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Oscard.</p>
<p>And that was all they could say.&nbsp; Durnovo never left them alone
together that night.&nbsp; He watched their faces with keen, suspicious
eyes.&nbsp; Behind the moustache his lips were pursed up in restless
anxiety.&nbsp; But he saw nothing&mdash;learnt nothing.&nbsp; These
two men were inscrutable.</p>
<p>At eleven o&rsquo;clock the next morning the Simiacine seekers left
their first unhappy camp at Msala.&nbsp; They had tasted of misfortune
at the very beginning, but after the first reverse they returned to
their work with that dogged determination which is a better spirit than
the wild enthusiasm of departure, where friends shout and flags wave,
and an artificial hopefulness throws in its jarring note.</p>
<p>They had left behind them with the artifice of civilisation that
subtle handicap of a woman&rsquo;s presence; and the little flotilla
of canoes that set sail from the terrace at Msala one morning in November,
not so many years ago, was essentially masculine in its bearing.&nbsp;
The four white men&mdash;quiet, self-contained, and intrepid&mdash;seemed
to work together with a perfect unity, a oneness of thought and action
which really lay in the brain of one of them.&nbsp; No man can define
a true leader; for one is too autocratic and the next too easily led;
one is too quick-tempered, another too reserved.&nbsp; It would almost
seem that the ideal leader is that man who knows how to extract from
the brains of his subordinates all that is best and strongest therein&mdash;who
knows how to suppress his own individuality, and merge it for the time
being into that of his fellow-worker&mdash;whose influence is from within
and not from without.</p>
<p>The most successful Presidents of Republics have been those who are,
or pretend to be, nonentities, content to be mere pegs, standing still
and lifeless, for things to be hung upon.&nbsp; Jack Meredith was, or
pretended to be, this.&nbsp; He never assumed the airs of a leader.&nbsp;
He never was a leader.&nbsp; He merely smoothed things over, suggested
here, laughed there, and seemed to stand by, indifferent all the while.</p>
<p>In less than a week they left the river, hauling their canoes up
on the bank, and hiding them in the tangle of the virgin underwood.&nbsp;
A depot of provisions, likewise hidden, was duly made, and the long,
weary march began.</p>
<p>The daily routine of this need not be followed, for there were weeks
of long monotony, varied only by a new difficulty, a fresh danger, or
a deplorable accident.&nbsp; Twice the whole company had to lay aside
the baggage and assume arms, when Guy Oscard proved himself to be a
cool and daring leader.&nbsp; Not twice, but two hundred times, the
ring of Joseph&rsquo;s unerring rifle sent some naked savage crawling
into the brake to die, with a sudden wonder in his half-awakened brain.&nbsp;
They could not afford to be merciful; their only safeguard was to pass
through this country, leaving a track of blood and fire and dread behind
them.</p>
<p>This, however, is no record of travel in Central Africa.&nbsp; There
are many such to be had at any circulating library, written by abler
and more fantastic pens.&nbsp; Some of us who have wandered in the darkest
continent have looked in vain for things seen by former travellers&mdash;things
which, as the saying is, are neither here nor there.&nbsp; Indeed, there
is not much to see in a vast, boundless forest with little life and
no variety&mdash;nothing but a deadly monotony of twilit tangle.&nbsp;
There is nothing new under the sun&mdash;even immediately under it in
Central Africa.&nbsp; The only novelty is the human heart&mdash;Central
Man.&nbsp; That is never stale, and there are depths still unexplored,
heights still unattained, warm rivers of love, cold streams of hatred,
and vast plains where strange motives grow.&nbsp; These are our business.</p>
<p>We have not to deal so much with the finding of the Simiacine as
with the finders, and of these the chief at this time was Jack Meredith.&nbsp;
It seemed quite natural that one duty after another should devolve upon
him, and he invariably had time to do them all, and leisure to comment
pleasantly upon it.&nbsp; But his chief care was Victor Durnovo.</p>
<p>As soon as they entered the forest, two hundred miles above Msala,
the half-breed was a changed man.&nbsp; The strange restlessness asserted
itself again&mdash;the man was nervous, eager, sincere.&nbsp; His whole
being was given up to this search; his whole heart and soul were enveloped
in it.&nbsp; At first he worked steadily, like a mariner treading his
way through known waters; but gradually his composure left him, and
he became incapable of doing other work.</p>
<p>Jack Meredith was at his side always.&nbsp; By day he walked near
him as he piloted the column through the trackless forest.&nbsp; At
night he slept in the same tent, stretched across the doorway.&nbsp;
Despite the enormous fatigue, he slept the light sleep of the townsman,
and often he was awakened by Durnovo talking aloud, groaning, tossing
on his narrow bed.</p>
<p>When they had been on the march for two months&mdash;piloted with
marvellous instinct by Durnovo&mdash;Meredith made one or two changes
in the organisation.&nbsp; The caravan naturally moved slowly, owing
to the enormous amount of baggage to be carried, and this delay seemed
to irritate Victor Durnovo to such an extent that at last it was obvious
that the man would go mad unless this enormous tension could be relieved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; he would shout, &ldquo;hurry
those men on!&nbsp; We haven&rsquo;t done ten miles to-day.&nbsp; Another
man down&mdash;damn him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And more than once he had to be dragged forcibly away from the fallen
porter, whom he battered with both fists.&nbsp; Had he had his will,
he would have allowed no time for meals, and only a few hours&rsquo;
halt for rest.&nbsp; Guy Oscard did not understand it.&nbsp; His denser
nerves were incapable of comprehending the state of irritation and unreasoning
restlessness into which the climate and excitement had brought Durnovo.&nbsp;
But Meredith, in his finer organisation, understood the case better.&nbsp;
He it was who soothingly explained the necessity for giving the men
a longer rest.&nbsp; He alone could persuade Durnovo to lie down at
night and cease his perpetual calculations.&nbsp; The man&rsquo;s hands
were so unsteady that he could hardly take the sights necessary to determine
their position in this sea-like waste.&nbsp; And to Jack alone did Victor
Durnovo ever approach the precincts of mutual confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it, Meredith,&rdquo; he said one day, with
a scared look, after a particularly violent outburst of temper.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it is.&nbsp; I sometimes think I am going
mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And soon after that the change was made.</p>
<p>An advance column, commanded by Meredith and Durnovo, was selected
to push on to the Plateau, while Oscard and Joseph followed more leisurely
with the baggage and the slower travellers.</p>
<p>One of the strangest journeys in the vast unwritten history of commercial
advance was that made by the five men from the camp of the main expedition
across the lower slopes of a mountain range&mdash;unmarked on any map,
unnamed by any geographer&mdash;to the mysterious Simiacine Plateau.&nbsp;
It almost seemed as if the wild, bloodshot eyes of their guide could
pierce the density of the forest where Nature had held unchecked, untrimmed
sway for countless generations.&nbsp; Victor Durnovo noted a thousand
indications unseen by his four companions.&nbsp; The journey no longer
partook of the nature of a carefully calculated progress across a country
untrodden by a white man&rsquo;s foot; it was a wild rush in a straight
line through unbroken forest fastness, guided by an instinct that was
stronger than knowledge.&nbsp; And the only Englishman in the party&mdash;Jack
Meredith&mdash;had to choose between madness and rest.&nbsp; He knew
enough of the human brain to be convinced that the only possible relief
to this tension was success.</p>
<p>Victor Durnovo would never know rest now until he reached the spot
where the Simiacine should be.&nbsp; If the trees were there, growing,
as he said, in solitary state and order, strangely suggestive of human
handiwork, then Victor Durnovo was saved.&nbsp; If no such spot was
found, madness and death could only follow.</p>
<p>To save his companion&rsquo;s reason, Meredith more than once drugged
his food; but when the land began to rise beneath their feet in tentative,
billow-like inequalities&mdash;the deposit of a glacial age&mdash;Durnovo
refused to stop for the preparation of food.&nbsp; Eating dry biscuits
and stringy tinned meat as they went along, the four men&mdash;three
blacks and one white&mdash;followed in the footsteps of their mad pilot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting to the mountains&mdash;we&rsquo;re getting
to the mountains!&nbsp; We shall be there to-night!&nbsp; Think of that,
Meredith&mdash;to-night!&rdquo; he kept repeating with a sickening monotony.&nbsp;
And all the while he stumbled on.&nbsp; The perspiration ran down his
face in one continuous stream; at times he paused to wipe it from his
eyes with the back of his hands, and as these were torn and bleeding,
there were smears of blood across his cheeks.</p>
<p>The night fell; the moon rose, red and glorious, and the beasts of
this untrodden forest paused in their search for meat to watch with
wondering, fearless eyes that strange, unknown animal&mdash;man.</p>
<p>It was Durnovo who, climbing wildly, first saw the break in the trees
ahead.&nbsp; He gave a muffled cry of delight, and in a few minutes
they were all rushing, like men possessed, up a bare slope of broken
shale.</p>
<p>Durnovo reached the summit first.&nbsp; A faint, pleasant odour was
wafted into their faces.&nbsp; They stood on the edge of a vast table-land
melting away in the yellow moonlight.&nbsp; Studded all over, like sheep
in a meadow, were a number of little bushes, and no other vegetation.</p>
<p>Victor Durnovo stooped over one of these.&nbsp; He buried his face
among the leaves of it, and suddenly he toppled over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he cried as he fell, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Simiacine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he turned over with a groan of satisfaction, and lay like a dead
man.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI.&nbsp; THE FIRST CONSIGNMENT</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Since all that I can ever do for
thee<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is to do nothing, may&rsquo;st
thou never see,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never divine, the
all that nothing costeth me.</i></p>
<p>One morning, three months later, Guy Oscard drew up in line his flying
column.&nbsp; He was going back to England with the first consignment
of Simiacine.&nbsp; During the twelve weeks that lay behind there had
been constant reference made to his little body of picked men, and the
leader had selected with a grave deliberation that promised well.</p>
<p>The lost soldier that was in him was all astir in his veins as he
reviewed his command in the cool air of early morning.&nbsp; The journey
from Msala to the Plateau had occupied a busy two months.&nbsp; Oscard
expected to reach Msala with his men in forty days.&nbsp; Piled up in
neat square cases, such as could be carried in pairs by a man of ordinary
strength, was the crop of Simiacine, roughly valued by Victor Durnovo
at forty thousand pounds.&nbsp; Ten men could carry the whole of it,
and the twenty cases set close together on the ground made a bed for
Guy Oscard.&nbsp; Upon this improvised couch he gravely stretched his
bulk every night all through the journey that followed.</p>
<p>Over the whole face of the sparsely vegetated table-land the dwarf
bushes grew at intervals, each one in a little circle of its own, where
no grass grew: for the dead leaves, falling, poisoned the earth.&nbsp;
There were no leaves on the bushes now, for they had all been denuded,
and the twisted branches stood out naked in the morning mist.&nbsp;
Some of the bushes had been roughly pruned, to foster, if possible,
a more bushy growth and a heavier crop of leaves near to the parent
stem.</p>
<p>It was a strange landscape; and any passing traveller, knowing nothing
of the Simiacine, must perforce have seen at once that these insignificant
little trees were something quite apart in the vegetable kingdom.&nbsp;
Each standing with its magic circle, no bird built its nest within the
branches&mdash;no insect constructed its filmy home&mdash;no spider
weaved its busy web from twig to twig.</p>
<p>Solitary, mournful, lifeless the Plateau which had nearly cost Victor
Durnovo his life lay beneath the face of heaven, far above the surrounding
country&mdash;the summit of an unnamed mountain&mdash;a land lying in
the heart of a tropic country which was neither tropic, temperate, nor
arctic.&nbsp; Fauna had it none, for it produced nothing that could
sustain life.&nbsp; Flora it knew not, for the little trees, with their
perennial fortune of brilliant brown-tinted leaves, monopolised vegetable
life, and slew all comers.&nbsp; It seemed like some stray tract of
another planet, where the condition of living things was different.&nbsp;
There was a strange sense of having been thrown up&mdash;thrown up,
as it were, into mid-heaven, there to hang for ever&mdash;neither this
world nor the world to come.&nbsp; The silence of it all was such as
would drive men mad if they came to think of it.&nbsp; It was the silence
of the stars.</p>
<p>The men who had lived up here for three months did not look quite
natural.&nbsp; There was a singular heaviness of the eyelids which all
had noticed, though none had spoken of it.&nbsp; A craving for animal
food, which could only be stayed by the consumption of abnormal quantities
of meat, kept the hunters ever at work on the lower slopes of the mountain.&nbsp;
Sleep was broken, and uncanny things happened in the night.&nbsp; Men
said that they saw other men like trees, walking abroad with sightless
eyes; and Joseph said, &ldquo;Gammon, my festive darky&mdash;gammon!&rdquo;
but he, nevertheless, glanced somewhat uneasily towards his master whenever
the natives said such things.</p>
<p>A clearing had been made on that part of the Plateau which was most
accessible from below.&nbsp; The Simiacine trees had been ruthlessly
cut away&mdash;even the roots were grubbed up and burnt&mdash;far away
on the leeward side of the little kingdom.&nbsp; This was done because
there arose at sunset a soft and pleasant odour from the bushes which
seemed to affect the nerves, and even made the teeth chatter.&nbsp;
It was, therefore, deemed wise that the camp should stand on bare ground.</p>
<p>It was on this ground, in front of the tents, that Guy Oscard drew
up his quick-marching column before the sun had sprung up in its fantastic
tropical way from the distant line of virgin forest.&nbsp; As he walked
along the line, making a suggestion here, pulling on a shoulder-rope
there, he looked staunch and strong as any man might wish to be.&nbsp;
His face was burnt so brown that eyebrows and moustache stood out almost
blonde, though in reality they were only brown.&nbsp; His eyes did not
seem to be suffering from the heaviness noticeable in others; altogether,
the climate and the mystic breath of the Simiacine grove did not appear
to affect him as it did his companions.&nbsp; This was probably accounted
for by the fact that, being chief of the hunters, most of his days had
been passed on the lower slopes in search of game.</p>
<p>To him came presently Jack Meredith&mdash;the same gentle-mannered
man, with an incongruously brown face and quick eyes seeing all.&nbsp;
It is not, after all, the life that makes the man.&nbsp; There are gentle
backwoodsmen, and ruffians among those who live in drawing-rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Meredith, following the glance of his friend&rsquo;s
eye as he surveyed his men.</p>
<p>Oscard took his pipe from his lips and looked gravely at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t half like it, you know,&rdquo; he said in a low
voice; for Durnovo was talking with a head porter a few yards away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t half like what?&mdash;the flavour of that pipe?&nbsp;
It looks a little strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, leaving you here,&rdquo; replied Oscard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right, old chap! You can&rsquo;t take
me with you, you know.&nbsp; I intended to stick to it when I came away
from home, and I am not going to turn back now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oscard gave a queer little upward jerk of the head, as if he had
just collected further evidence in support of a theory which chronically
surprised him.&nbsp; Then he turned away and looked down over the vast
untrodden tract of Africa that lay beneath them.&nbsp; He kept his eyes
fixed there, after the manner of a man who has no fluency in personal
comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he said jerkily, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think&mdash;I
mean you&rsquo;re not the sort of chap I took you for.&nbsp; When I
first saw you I thought you were a bit of a dandy and&mdash;all that.&nbsp;
Not the sort of man for this work.&nbsp; I thought that the thing was
bound to be a failure.&nbsp; I knew Durnovo, and had no faith in him.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve got a gentle way about you, and your clothes are so confoundedly
neat.&nbsp; But&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Here he paused and pulled down the
folds of his Norfolk jacket.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I liked the way you shot
that leopard the day we first met.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beastly fluke,&rdquo; put in Meredith, with his pleasant laugh.</p>
<p>Oscard contented himself with a denying shake of the head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he continued, with obvious determination
to get it all off his mind, &ldquo;I know as well as you do that you
are the chief of this concern&mdash;have been chief since we left Msala&mdash;and
I never want to work under a better man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put his pipe back between his lips and turned round with a contented
smile, as much as to say, &ldquo;There, that is the sort of man I am!&nbsp;
When I want to say that sort of thing I can say it with the best of
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have pulled along very comfortably, haven&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
said Meredith; &ldquo;thanks to your angelic temper.&nbsp; And you&rsquo;ll
deliver that packet of letters to the governor, won&rsquo;t you?&nbsp;
I have sent them in one packet, addressed to him, as it is easier to
carry.&nbsp; I will let you hear of us somehow within the next six months.&nbsp;
Do not go and get married before I get home.&nbsp; I want to be your
best man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oscard laughed and gave the signal for the men to start, and the
long caravan defiled before them.&nbsp; The porters nodded to Meredith
with a great display of white teeth, while the head men, the captains
of tens, stepped out of the ranks and shook hands.&nbsp; Before they
had disappeared over the edge of the plateau, Joseph came forward to
say good-bye to Oscard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it is understood,&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;that
I pay in to your account at Lloyd&rsquo;s Bank your share of the proceeds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joseph grinned.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, sir, if you please, presumin&rsquo;
it&rsquo;s a safe bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safe as houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cos it&rsquo;s a tolerable big amount,&rdquo; settling
himself into his boots in the manner of a millionaire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lot of money&mdash;about four hundred pounds!&nbsp; But you
can trust me to see to it all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fear, sir,&rdquo; replied Joseph grandly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
quite content, I&rsquo;m sure, that you should have the&mdash;fingering
o&rsquo; the dibs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he finished&mdash;somewhat lamely perhaps&mdash;his rounded periods,
he looked very deliberately over Oscard&rsquo;s shoulder towards Durnovo,
who was approaching them.</p>
<p>Meredith walked a little way down the slope with Oscard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, old chap!&rdquo; he said when the parting came.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Good luck, and all that.&nbsp; Hope you will find all right at
home.&nbsp; By the way,&rdquo; he shouted after him, &ldquo;give my
kind regards to the Gordons at Loango.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so the first consignment of Simiacine was sent from the Plateau
to the coast.</p>
<p>Guy Oscard was one of those deceptive men who only do a few things,
and do those few very well.&nbsp; In forty-three days he deposited the
twenty precious cases in Gordon&rsquo;s godowns at Loango, and paid
off the porters, of whom he had not lost one.&nbsp; These duties performed,
he turned his steps towards the bungalow.&nbsp; He had refused Gordon&rsquo;s
invitation to stay with him until the next day, when the coasting steamer
was expected.&nbsp; To tell the truth, he was not very much prepossessed
in Maurice&rsquo;s favour, and it was with a doubtful mind that he turned
his steps towards the little house in the forest between Loango and
the sea.</p>
<p>The room was the first surprise that awaited him, its youthful mistress
the second.&nbsp; Guy Oscard was rather afraid of most women.&nbsp;
He did not understand them, and probably he despised them.&nbsp; Men
who are afraid or ignorant often do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when did you leave them?&rdquo; asked Jocelyn, after her
visitor had explained who he was.&nbsp; He was rather taken aback by
so much dainty refinement in remote Africa, and explained rather badly.&nbsp;
But she helped him out by intimating that she knew all about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left them forty-four days ago,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And were they well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is very much interested,&rdquo; reflected Oscard, upon
whom her eagerness of manner had not been lost.&nbsp; &ldquo;Surely,
it cannot be that fellow Durnovo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he replied with unconscious curtness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Durnovo cannot ever remain inland for long without feeling
the effect of the climate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy Oscard, with the perspicacity of his sex, gobbled up the bait.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It <i>is</i> Durnovo,&rdquo; he reflected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he is all right,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;wonderfully well,
and so are the others&mdash;Joseph and Meredith.&nbsp; You know Meredith?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jocelyn was busy with a vase of flowers standing on the table at
her elbow.&nbsp; One of the flowers had fallen half out, and she was
replacing it&mdash;very carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she said, without ceasing her occupation,
&ldquo;we know Mr. Meredith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The visitor did not speak at once, and she looked up at him, over
the flowers, with grave politeness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meredith,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is one of the most remarkable
men I have ever met.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was evident that this ordinarily taciturn man wanted to unburthen
his mind.&nbsp; He was desirous of talking to some one of Jack Meredith;
and perhaps Jocelyn reflected that she was as good a listener as he
would find in Loango.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; she replied with a kindly interest.&nbsp; &ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, not because he found it difficult to talk to this woman,
but because he was thinking of something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have read or heard somewhere of a steel gauntlet beneath
a velvet glove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That describes Meredith.&nbsp; He is not the man I took him
for.&nbsp; He is so wonderfully polite and gentle and pleasant.&nbsp;
Not the qualities that make a good leader for an African exploring expedition&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jocelyn gave a strange little laugh, which included, among other
things, a subtle intimation that she rather liked Guy Oscard.&nbsp;
Women do convey these small meanings sometimes, but one finds that they
do not intend them to be acted upon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he has kept well all the time?&rdquo; she asked softly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He did not look strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes.&nbsp; He is much stronger than he looks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&mdash;you have been all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going back to&mdash;them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I leave to-morrow morning early by the Portuguese boat.&nbsp;
I am going home to be married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&nbsp; Then I suppose you will wash your hands of Africa
for ever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I told Meredith
that I would be prepared to go up to him in case of emergency, but not
otherwise.&nbsp; I shall, of course, still be interested in the scheme.&nbsp;
I take home the first consignment of Simiacine; we have been very successful,
you know.&nbsp; I shall have to stay in London to sell that.&nbsp; I
have a house there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you to be married at once?&rdquo; inquired Jocelyn, with
that frank interest which makes it so much easier for a man to talk
of his own affairs to a woman than to one of his own sex.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as I can arrange it,&rdquo; he answered with a little
laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is nothing to wait for.&nbsp; We are both
orphans, and, fortunately, we are fairly well off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was fumbling in his breast-pocket, and presently he rose, crossed
the room, and handed her, quite without afterthought or self-consciousness,
a photograph in a morocco case.</p>
<p>Explanation was unnecessary, and Jocelyn Gordon looked smilingly
upon a smiling, bright young face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is very pretty,&rdquo; she said honestly.</p>
<p>Whereupon Guy Oscard grunted unintelligibly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Millicent,&rdquo; he said after a little pause&mdash;&ldquo;Millicent
is her name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Millicent?&rdquo; repeated Jocelyn&mdash;&ldquo;Millicent
<i>what</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Millicent Chyne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jocelyn folded the morocco case together and handed it back to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is very pretty,&rdquo; she repeated slowly, as if her
mind could only reproduce&mdash;it was incapable of creation.</p>
<p>Oscard looked puzzled.&nbsp; Having risen he did not sit down again,
and presently he took his leave, feeling convinced that Jocelyn was
about to faint.</p>
<p>When he was gone the girl sat wearily down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Millicent Chyne,&rdquo; she whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is
to be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she answered to herself after a while.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nothing.&nbsp; It is not my business.&nbsp; I can do nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat there&mdash;alone, as she had been all her life&mdash;until
the short tropical twilight fell over the forest.&nbsp; Quite suddenly
she burst into tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> my business,&rdquo; she sobbed.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is no good pretending otherwise; but I can do nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII.&nbsp; THE SECOND CONSIGNMENT</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;Who has lost all hope has also lost
all fear.</i></p>
<p>Among others, it was a strange thing that Jocelyn felt no surprise
at meeting the name of Millicent Chyne on the lips of another man.&nbsp;
Women understand these things better than we do.&nbsp; They understand
each other, and they seem to have a practical way of accepting human
nature as it is which we never learn to apply to our fellowmen.&nbsp;
They never bluster as we do, nor expect impossibilities from the frail.</p>
<p>Another somewhat singular residue left, as it were, in Jocelyn&rsquo;s
mind when the storm of emotion had subsided was a certain indefinite
tenderness for Millicent Chyne.&nbsp; She felt sure that Jack Meredith&rsquo;s
feeling for her was that feeling vaguely called the right one, and,
as such, unalterable.&nbsp; To this knowledge the subtle sympathy for
Millicent was perhaps attributable.&nbsp; But navigation with pen and
thought among the shoals and depths of a woman&rsquo;s heart is hazardous
and uncertain.</p>
<p>Coupled with this&mdash;as only a woman could couple contradictions&mdash;was
an unpardoning abhorrence for the deceit practised.&nbsp; But Jocelyn
knew the world well enough to suspect that, if she were ever brought
face to face with her meanness, Millicent would be able to bring about
her own forgiveness.&nbsp; It is the knowledge of this lamentable fact
that undermines the feminine sense of honour.</p>
<p>Lastly, there was a calm acceptance of the fact that Guy Oscard must
and would inevitably go to the wall.&nbsp; There could be no comparison
between the two men.&nbsp; Millicent Chyne could scarcely hesitate for
a moment.&nbsp; That she herself must likewise suffer uncomplainingly,
inevitably, seemed to be an equally natural consequence in Jocelyn Gordon&rsquo;s
mind.</p>
<p>She could not go to Jack Meredith and say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This woman is deceiving you, but I love you, and my love is
a nobler, grander thing than hers.&nbsp; It is no passing fancy of a
giddy, dazzled girl, but the deep strong passion of a woman almost in
the middle of her life.&nbsp; It is a love so complete, so sufficing,
that I know I could make you forget this girl.&nbsp; I could so envelop
you with love, so watch over you and care for you, and tend you and
understand you, that you <i>must</i> be happy.&nbsp; I feel that I could
make you happier than any other woman in the world could make you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jocelyn Gordon could not do this; and all the advanced females in
the world, all the blue stockings and divided skirts, all the wild women
and those who pant for burdens other than children, will never bring
it to pass that women can say such things.</p>
<p>And precisely because she could not say this, Jocelyn felt hot and
sick at the very thought that Jack Meredith should learn aught of Millicent
Chyne from her.&nbsp; Her own inner motive in divulging what she had
learnt from Guy Oscard could never for a moment be hidden behind a wish,
however sincere, to act for the happiness of two honourable gentlemen.</p>
<p>Jocelyn had no one to consult&mdash;no one to whom she could turn,
in the maddening difficulty of her position, for advice or sympathy.&nbsp;
She had to work it out by herself, steering through the quicksands by
that compass that knows no deviation&mdash;the compass of her own honour
and maidenly reserve.</p>
<p>Just because she was so sure of her own love she felt that she could
never betray the falseness of Millicent Chyne.&nbsp; She felt somehow
that Millicent&rsquo;s fall in Jack Meredith&rsquo;s estimation would
drag down with it the whole of her sex, and consequently herself.&nbsp;
She did not dare to betray Millicent, because the honour of her sex
must be held up by an exaggerated honour in herself.&nbsp; Thus her
love for Jack Meredith tied her hands, while she stood idly by to see
him wreck his own life by what could only be a miserable union.</p>
<p>With the clear sight of the onlooker, Jocelyn Gordon now saw that,
by Jack Meredith&rsquo;s own showing, Millicent was quite unworthy of
him.&nbsp; But she also remembered words, silences, and hints which
demonstrated with lamentable plainness the fact that he loved her.&nbsp;
She was old enough and sufficiently experienced to avoid the futile
speculation as to what had attracted this love.&nbsp; She knew that
men marry women who in the estimation of onlooking relatives are unworthy
of them, and live happily ever afterwards, without deeming it necessary
to explain to those relatives how it comes about.</p>
<p>Now it happened that this woman&mdash;Jocelyn Gordon&mdash;was not
one of those who gracefully betray themselves at the right moment and
are immediately covered with a most becoming confusion.&nbsp; She was
strong to hold to her purpose, to subdue herself, to keep silent.&nbsp;
And this task she set herself, having thought it all carefully out in
the little flower-scented verandah, so full of pathetic association.&nbsp;
But it must be remembered that she in no wise seemed to see the pathos
in her own life.&nbsp; She was unconscious of romance.&nbsp; It was
all plain fact, and the plainest was her love for Jack Meredith.</p>
<p>Her daily life was in no perceptible way changed.&nbsp; Maurice Gordon
saw no difference.&nbsp; She had never been an hilarious person.&nbsp;
Now she went about her household, her kindnesses, and unobtrusive good
works with a quieter mien; but, when occasion or social duty demanded,
she seemed perhaps a little readier than before to talk of indifferent
topics, to laugh at indifferent wit.&nbsp; Those who have ears to hear
and eyes wherewith to see learn to distrust the laugh that is too ready,
the sympathy that flows in too broad a stream.&nbsp; Happiness is self-absorbed.</p>
<p>Four months elapsed, and the excitement created in the small world
of Western Africa by the first dazzling success of the Simiacine Expedition
began to subside.&nbsp; The thing took its usual course.&nbsp; At first
the experts disbelieved, and then they prophesied that it could not
last.&nbsp; Finally, the active period of envy, hatred, and malice gave
way to a sullen tolerance not unmixed with an indefinite grudge towards
Fortune who had favoured the brave once more.</p>
<p>Maurice Gordon was in daily expectation of news from that far-off
favoured spot they vaguely called the Plateau.&nbsp; And Jocelyn did
not pretend to conceal from herself the hope that filled her whole being&mdash;the
hope that Jack Meredith might bring the news in person.</p>
<p>Instead, came Victor Durnovo.</p>
<p>He came upon her one evening when she was walking slowly home from
a mild tea-party at the house of a missionary.&nbsp; Hearing footsteps
on the sandy soil, she turned, and found herself face to face with Durnovo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she exclaimed, and her voice thrilled with some
emotion which he did not understand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, it is you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, holding her hand a little longer than
was necessary.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His journey from Msala through the more civilised reaches of the
lower river, his voyage in the coasting boat, and his arrival at Loango,
had partaken of the nature of a triumphal progress.&nbsp; Victor Durnovo
was elated&mdash;like a girl in a new dress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was coming along to see you,&rdquo; he said, and there was
a subtle offence in his tone.</p>
<p>She did not trouble to tell him that Maurice was away for ten days.&nbsp;
She felt that he knew that.&nbsp; There was a certain truculence in
his walk which annoyed her; but she was wonderingly conscious of the
fact that she was no longer afraid of him.&nbsp; This feeling had as
yet taken no definite shape.&nbsp; She did not know what she felt, but
she knew that there was no fear in her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been successful?&rdquo; she asked, with a certain
negative kindness of tone bred of this new self-confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think we had!&nbsp; Why, the lot that Oscard brought
down was a fortune in itself.&nbsp; But you saw Oscard, of course.&nbsp;
Did he stay at the bungalow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; he stayed at the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you like him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question was accompanied by a momentary glance of the dark, jealous
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a nice fellow, first-rate fellow.&nbsp; Of course, he
has his faults, but he and I got on splendidly.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s&mdash;engaged,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Durnovo glanced at her again searchingly, and looked relieved.&nbsp;
He gave an awkward little laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I understand,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that Meredith is
in the same enviable position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Durnovo indulged in a meaning silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do you go back?&rdquo; she asked carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost at once,&rdquo; in a tone that apologised for causing
her necessary pain.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must leave to-morrow or the next
day.&nbsp; I do not like the idea of Meredith being left too long alone
up there with a reduced number of men.&nbsp; Of course, I had to bring
a pretty large escort.&nbsp; I brought down sixty thousand pounds worth
of Simiacine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and you take all the men back
to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not remember having stated for certain that he was leaving
the next day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or the day after,&rdquo; he amended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you had any more sickness among the men?&rdquo; she asked
at once, in a tone of irony which made him wince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;they have been quite all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time do you start?&rdquo; she asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
are letters for Mr. Meredith at the office.&nbsp; Maurice&rsquo;s head
clerk will give them to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She knew that these letters were from Millicent.&nbsp; She had actually
had them in her hand.&nbsp; She had inhaled the faint, refined scent
of the paper and envelopes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be careful that they are not lost, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
she said, tearing at her own heart with a strange love of the pain.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They may be important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I will deliver them sharp enough,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I suppose I had better start to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think so,&rdquo; she replied quietly, with that gentle
mendacity which can scarcely be grudged to women, because they are so
poorly armed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should think so.&nbsp; You know what these
men are.&nbsp; Every hour they have in Loango demoralises them more
and more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had reached the gate of the bungalow garden.&nbsp; She turned
and held out her hand in an undeniable manner.&nbsp; He bade her good-bye
and went his way, wondering vaguely what had happened to them both.&nbsp;
The conversation had taken quite a different turn to what he had expected
and intended.&nbsp; But somehow it had got beyond his control.&nbsp;
He had looked forward to a very different ending to the interview.&nbsp;
And now he found himself returning somewhat disconsolately to the wretched
hotel in Loango&mdash;dismissed&mdash;sent back.</p>
<p>The next day he actually left the little West African coast town,
turning his face northward with bad grace.&nbsp; Even at that distance,
he feared Jack Meredith&rsquo;s half-veiled sarcasm.&nbsp; He knew that
nothing could be hidden for long from the Englishman&rsquo;s suavely
persistent inquiry and deduction.&nbsp; Besides, the natives were no
longer safe.&nbsp; Meredith, with the quickness of a cultured linguist,
had picked up enough of their language to understand them, while Joseph
talked freely with them in that singular mixture of slang and vernacular
which follows the redcoat all over the world.&nbsp; Durnovo had only
been allowed to come down to the coast under a promise, gracefully veiled,
but distinct enough, that he should only remain twenty-four hours in
Loango.</p>
<p>Jocelyn avoided seeing him again.&nbsp; She was forced to forego
the opportunity of hearing much that she wanted to learn because Durnovo,
the source of the desired knowledge, was unsafe.&nbsp; But the relief
from the suspense of the last few months was in itself a consolation.&nbsp;
All seemed to be going on well at the Plateau.&nbsp; Danger is always
discounted at sight; and Jocelyn felt comparatively easy respecting
the present welfare of Jack Meredith, living as she did on the edge
of danger.</p>
<p>Four days later she was riding through the native town of Loango,
accompanied by a lady-friend, when she met Victor Durnovo.&nbsp; The
sight of him gave her a distinct shock.&nbsp; She knew that he had left
Loango three days before with all his men.&nbsp; There was no doubt
about that.&nbsp; Moreover, his air was distinctly furtive&mdash;almost
scared.&nbsp; It was evident that the chance meeting was as undesired
by him as it was surprising to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you had left,&rdquo; she said shortly, pulling up
her horse with undeniable decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. . .&nbsp; but I have come back&mdash;for&mdash;for more
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She knew he was lying, and he felt that she knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are not a good starter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned her horse&rsquo;s head, nodded to her friend, bowed coldly
to Durnovo, and trotted towards home.&nbsp; When she had reached the
corner of the rambling, ill-paved street, she touched her horse.&nbsp;
The animal responded.&nbsp; She broke into a gentle canter, which made
the little children cease their play and stare.&nbsp; In the forest
she applied the spurs, and beneath the whispering trees, over the silent
sand, the girl galloped home as fast as her horse could lay legs to
the ground.</p>
<p>Jocelyn Gordon was one of those women who rise slowly to the occasion,
and the limit of their power seems at times to be only defined by the
greatness of the need.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.&nbsp; MERCURY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>So cowards never use their might<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But
against such that will not fight.</i></p>
<p>On nearing the bungalow, Jocelyn turned aside into the forest where
a little colony of huts nestled in a hollow of the sand-dunes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&acirc;la,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;the paddle-maker.&nbsp;
Ask him to come to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke in the dialect of the coast to some women who sat together
before one of the huts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&acirc;la&mdash;yes,&rdquo; they answered.&nbsp; And they
raised their strident voices.</p>
<p>In a few moments a man emerged from a shed of banana-leaves.&nbsp;
He was a scraggy man&mdash;very lightly clad&mdash;and a violent squint
handicapped him seriously in the matter of first impressions.&nbsp;
When he saw Jocelyn he dropped his burden of wood and ran towards her.&nbsp;
The African negro does not cringe.&nbsp; He is a proud man in his way.&nbsp;
If he is properly handled, he is not only trustworthy&mdash;he is something
stronger.&nbsp; N&acirc;la grinned as he ran towards Jocelyn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&acirc;la,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;will you go a journey
for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to you,&rdquo; said Jocelyn, &ldquo;because I know
that you are an intelligent man and a great traveller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have travelled much,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;when I was
younger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before you were married?&rdquo; said the English girl.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Before little N&acirc;la came?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man grinned.</p>
<p>He looked back over his shoulder towards one of the huts, where a
scraggy infant with a violent squint lay on its diaphragm on the sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you wish me to go?&rdquo; asked the proud father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Msala on the Ogowe river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the Ogowe.&nbsp; I have been at Msala,&rdquo; with
the grave nod of a great traveller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When can you leave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jocelyn had her purse in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can hire a dhow,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and on the river
you may have as many rowers as you like.&nbsp; You must go very quickly
to Msala.&nbsp; There you must ask about the Englishman&rsquo;s Expedition.&nbsp;
You have heard of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes: the Englishman, Durnovo, and the soldier who laughs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Some of the men are at Msala now.&nbsp; They were
going up-country to join the other Englishman far away&mdash;near the
mountains.&nbsp; They have stopped at Msala.&nbsp; Find out why they
have not gone on, and come back very quickly to tell me.&nbsp; You understand,
N&acirc;la?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I can trust you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes: because you cured the little one when he had an evil
spirit.&nbsp; Yes, you can trust me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave him money and rode on home.&nbsp; Before she reached the
bungalow the paddle-maker passed her at a trot, going towards the sea.</p>
<p>She waited for three days, and then Victor Durnovo came again.&nbsp;
Maurice was still away.&nbsp; There was an awful sense of impending
danger in the very air in the loneliness of her position.&nbsp; Yet
she was not afraid of Durnovo.&nbsp; She had left that fear behind.&nbsp;
She went to the drawing-room to see him, full of resolution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not go away,&rdquo; he said, after relinquishing her
hand, &ldquo;without coming to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jocelyn said nothing.&nbsp; The scared look which she had last seen
in his face was no longer there; but the eyes were full of lies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jocelyn,&rdquo; the man went on, &ldquo;I suppose you know
that I love you?&nbsp; It must have been plain to you for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered, with a little catch in her breath.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, it has not.&nbsp; And I am sorry to hear it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he asked, with a dull gleam which could not be
dignified by the name of love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it can only lead to trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victor Durnovo was standing with his back to the window, while Jocelyn,
in the full light of the afternoon, stood before him.&nbsp; He looked
her slowly up and down with a glance of approval which alarmed and disquieted
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you marry me?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His black moustache was pushed forward by some motion of the hidden
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want the real reason?&rdquo; asked Jocelyn.</p>
<p>Victor Durnovo paused for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I not only do not care for you, but I despise and
distrust you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are candid,&rdquo; he said, with an unpleasant little
laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He moved a little to one side and drew a chair towards him, half-leaning,
half-sitting on the back of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will be candid with you.&nbsp;
I intend you to marry me; I have intended it for a long time.&nbsp;
I am not going down on my knees to ask you to do it: that is not my
way.&nbsp; But, if you drive me to it, I will make your brother Maurice
go down on his knees and beg you to marry me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you will do that,&rdquo; answered the
girl steadily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whatever your power over Maurice may be,
it is not strong enough for that; you overrate it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think so?&rdquo; he sneered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Durnovo glanced hastily round the room in order to make sure that
they were not overheard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; he said, in a low, hissing voice, &ldquo;that
I possess knowledge that I have only to mention to one or two people
to make this place too hot for Maurice Gordon.&nbsp; If he escaped the
fury of the natives, it would be difficult to know where he could go
to.&nbsp; England would be too hot for him.&nbsp; They wouldn&rsquo;t
have him there; I could see to that.&nbsp; He would be a ruined man&mdash;an
outcast&mdash;execrated by all the civilised world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was watching her face all the while.&nbsp; He saw the colour leave
even her lips, but they were steady and firm.&nbsp; A strange wonder
crept into his heart.&nbsp; This woman never flinched.&nbsp; There was
some reserved strength within herself upon which she was now drawing.&nbsp;
His dealings had all been with half-castes&mdash;with impure blood and
doubtful descendants of a mixed ancestry.&nbsp; He had never fairly
roused a pure-bred English man or woman, and suddenly he began to feel
out of his depth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your knowledge?&rdquo; asked Jocelyn in a coldly measured
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you had better not ask that; you will be sorry afterwards.&nbsp;
I would rather that you thought quietly over what I have told you.&nbsp;
Perhaps, on second thoughts, you will see your way to give me some&mdash;slight
hope.&nbsp; I should really advise it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not ask your advice.&nbsp; What is your knowledge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have it?&rdquo; he hissed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leant forward, craning his neck, pushing his yellow face and hungering
black eyes close into hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, if you will have it, your brother&mdash;Maurice Gordon&mdash;is
a slave-owner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew back as she might have done from some unclean animal.&nbsp;
She knew that he was telling the truth.&nbsp; There might be extenuating
circumstances.&nbsp; The real truth might have quite a different sound,
spoken in different words; but there was enough of the truth in it,
as Victor Durnovo placed it before her, to condemn Maurice before the
world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now will you marry me?&rdquo; he sneered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quick as thought she had seen the only loophole&mdash;the only possible
way of meeting this terrible accusation.</p>
<p>He laughed; but there was a faint jangle of uneasiness in his laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing,&rdquo; said Jocelyn, &ldquo;for one moment that
there was a grain of truth in your fabrication, who would believe you?&nbsp;
Who on this coast would take your word against the word of an English
gentleman?&nbsp; Even if the whole story were true, which it is not,
could you prove it?&nbsp; You are a liar, as well as a coward and a
traitor!&nbsp; Do you think that the very servants in the stable would
believe you?&nbsp; Do you think that the incident of the small-pox at
Msala is forgotten?&nbsp; Do you think that all Loango, even to the
boatmen on the beach, ignores the fact that you are here in Loango now
because you are afraid to go through a savage country to the Simiacine
Plateau as you are pledged to do?&nbsp; You were afraid of the small-pox
once; there is something else that you are afraid of now.&nbsp; I do
not know what it is, but I will find out.&nbsp; Coward!&nbsp; Go!&nbsp;
Leave the house at once, before I call in the stable-boys to turn you
out, and never dare to speak to me again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victor Durnovo recoiled before her, conscious all the while that
she had never been so beautiful as at that moment.&nbsp; But she was
something far above him&mdash;a different creation altogether.&nbsp;
He never knew what drove him from that room.&nbsp; It was the fear of
something that he did not understand.</p>
<p>He heard her close the window after him as he walked away beneath
the trees.</p>
<p>She stood watching him&mdash;proud, cold, terrible in her womanly
anger.&nbsp; Then she turned, and suddenly sank down upon the sofa,
sobbing.</p>
<p>But fortune decreed that she should have neither time to weep nor
think.&nbsp; She heard the approaching footsteps of her old servant,
and when the door was opened Jocelyn Gordon was reading a book, with
her back turned towards the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man N&acirc;la, miss, the paddle-maker, wants to see
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him to go round to the verandah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jocelyn went out by the open window, and presently N&acirc;la came
grinning towards her.&nbsp; He was evidently very much pleased with
himself&mdash;held himself erect, and squinted more violently than usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been to Msala,&rdquo; he said, with considerable dignity
of manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and what news have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>N&acirc;la squatted down on the chunam floor, and proceeded to unfold
a leaf.&nbsp; The operation took some time.&nbsp; Within the outer covering
there was a second envelope of paper, likewise secured by a string.&nbsp;
Finally, the man produced a small note, which showed signs of having
been read more than once.&nbsp; This he handed to Jocelyn with an absurd
air of importance.</p>
<p>She opened the paper and read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To MARIE AT MSALA,&mdash;Send at once to Mr. Durnovo, informing
him that the tribes have risen and are rapidly surrounding the Plateau.&nbsp;
He must return here at once with as large an armed force as he can raise.&nbsp;
But the most important consideration is time.&nbsp; He must not wait
for men from elsewhere, but must pick up as many as he can in Loango
and on the way up to Msala.&nbsp; I reckon that we can hold out for
four months without outside assistance, but after that period we shall
be forced to surrender or to try and cut our way through <i>without</i>
the Simiacine.&nbsp; With a larger force we could beat back the tribes,
and establish our hold on the Plateau by force of arms.&nbsp; This must
be forwarded to Mr. Durnovo at once, wherever he is.&nbsp; The letter
is in duplicate, sent by two good messengers, who go by different routes.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOHN
MEREDITH.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Jocelyn looked up, dry-lipped, breathless, N&acirc;la was standing
before her, beaming with self-importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who gave you this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marie at Msala.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;Mr. Durnovo&rsquo;s woman at Msala.&nbsp; She keeps
his house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this letter is for Mr. Durnovo,&rdquo; cried Jocelyn,
whose fear made her unreasonably angry.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why has he not
had it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>N&acirc;la came nearer, with upraised forefinger and explanatory
palm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marie tell me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that Mr. Meredith send
two letters.&nbsp; Marie give Mr. Durnovo one.&nbsp; This&mdash;other
letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a strange glitter in the girl&rsquo;s blue eyes&mdash;something
steely and unpleasant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure of that?&nbsp; You are quite sure that Mr. Durnovo
has had a letter like this?&rdquo; she asked slowly and carefully, so
that there could be no mistake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; answered the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any more news from Msala?&rdquo;</p>
<p>N&acirc;la looked slightly hurt.&nbsp; He evidently thought that
he had brought as much news as one man could be expected to carry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marie has heard,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that there is much
fighting up in the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has heard no particulars&mdash;nothing more than that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No: nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jocelyn Gordon rose to this occasion also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you go,&rdquo; she said, after a moment&rsquo;s thought,
&ldquo;to St. Paul de Loanda for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At once&mdash;now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; with a sigh.</p>
<p>Already Jocelyn was writing something on a sheet of paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take this,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to the telegraph office
at St. Paul de Loanda, and send it off at once.&nbsp; Here is money.&nbsp;
You understand?&nbsp; I will pay you when you bring back the receipt.&nbsp;
If you have been very quick, I will pay you well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That same evening a second messenger started northward after Maurice
Gordon with a letter telling him to come back at once to Loango.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.&nbsp; NEMESIS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Take heed of still waters.</i></p>
<p>Despite his assertion to Lady Cantourne, Guy Oscard stayed on in
the gloomy house in Russell Square.&nbsp; He had naturally gone thither
on his return from Africa, and during the months that followed he did
not find time to think much of his own affairs.&nbsp; Millicent Chyne
occupied all his thoughts&mdash;all his waking moments.&nbsp; It is
marvellous how busily employed an active-minded young lady can keep
a man.</p>
<p>In the ill-lighted study rendered famous by the great history which
had emanated in the manuscript therefrom, Guy Oscard had interviewed
sundry great commercial experts, and a cheque for forty-eight thousand
pounds had been handed to him across the table polished bright by his
father&rsquo;s studious elbow.&nbsp; The Simiacine was sold, and the
first portion of it spent went to buy a diamond aigrette for the dainty
head of Miss Millicent Chyne.</p>
<p>Guy Oscard was in the midst of the London season.&nbsp; His wealth
and a certain restricted renown had soon made him popular.&nbsp; He
had only to choose his society, and the selection was not difficult.&nbsp;
Wherever Millicent Chyne went he went also, and to the lady&rsquo;s
credit it must be recorded that no one beyond herself and Guy Oscard
had hitherto noticed this fact.&nbsp; Millicent was nothing if not discreet.&nbsp;
It was more or less generally known that she was engaged to Jack Meredith,
who, although absent on some vaguely romantic quest of a fortune, was
not yet forgotten.&nbsp; No word, however, was popularly whispered connecting
her name with that of any other swain nearer home.&nbsp; Miss Chyne
was too much of a woman of the world to allow that.&nbsp; But, in the
meantime, she rather liked diamond aigrettes and the suppressed devotion
of Guy Oscard.</p>
<p>It was the evening of a great ball, and Guy Oscard, having received
his orders and instructions, was dining alone in Russell Square, when
a telegram was handed to him.&nbsp; He opened it and spread the thin
paper out upon the table-cloth.&nbsp; A word from that far, wild country,
which seemed so much fitter a background to his simple bulk and strength
than the cramped ways of London society&mdash;a message from the very
heart of the dark continent&mdash;to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meredith surrounded and in danger Durnovo false come at once
Jocelyn Gordon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy Oscard pushed back his chair and rose at once, as if there were
somebody waiting in the hall to see him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not want any more dinner,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am
going to Africa.&nbsp; Come and help me to pack my things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He studied Bradshaw and wrote a note to Millicent Chyne.&nbsp; To
her he said the same as he had said to the butler, &ldquo;I am going
to Africa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something refreshingly direct and simple about this man.&nbsp;
He did not enter into long explanations.&nbsp; He simply bore on in
the line he had marked out.&nbsp; He rose from the table and never looked
back.&nbsp; His attitude seemed to say, &ldquo;I am going to Africa;
kindly get out of my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At three minutes to nine&mdash;that is to say, in one hour and a
half&mdash;Guy Oscard took his seat in the Plymouth express.&nbsp; He
had ascertained that a Madeira boat was timed to sail from Dartmouth
at eight o&rsquo;clock that evening.&nbsp; He was preceded by a telegram
to Lloyd&rsquo;s agent at Plymouth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have fastest craft available, steam up ready to put to sea
to catch the Banyan African steamer four o&rsquo;clock to-morrow morning.&nbsp;
Expense not to be considered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the train crept out into the night, the butler of the gloomy house
in Russell Square, who had finished the port, and was beginning to feel
resigned, received a second shock.&nbsp; This came in the form of a
carriage and pair, followed by a ring at the bell.</p>
<p>The man opened the door, and his fellow servitor of an eccentric
class and generation stepped back on the door-step to let a young lady
pass into the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Oscard?&rdquo; she said curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Left &rsquo;ome, miss,&rdquo; replied the butler, stiffly
conscious of walnut-peel on his waistcoat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A matter of half an hour, miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Millicent Chyne, whose face was drawn and white, moved farther into
the hall.&nbsp; Seeing the dining-room door ajar, she passed into that
stately apartment, followed by the butler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Oscard sent me this note,&rdquo; she said, showing a crumpled
paper, &ldquo;saying that he was leaving for Africa to-night.&nbsp;
He gives no explanation.&nbsp; Why has he gone to Africa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He received a telegram while he was at dinner, miss,&rdquo;
replied the butler, whose knowledge of the world indicated the approach
of at least a sovereign.&nbsp; &ldquo;He rose and threw down his napkin,
miss.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to Africa,&rsquo; he says.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Come and help me pack.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see the telegram&mdash;by any chance?&rdquo; asked
Miss Chyne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, miss, I didn&rsquo;t rightly read it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Millicent had given way to a sudden panic on the receipt of Guy&rsquo;s
note.&nbsp; A telegram calling him to Africa&mdash;calling with a voice
which he obeyed with such alacrity that he had not paused to finish
his dinner&mdash;could only mean that some disaster had happened&mdash;some
disaster to Jack Meredith.&nbsp; And quite suddenly Millicent Chyne&rsquo;s
world was emptied of all else but Jack Meredith.&nbsp; For a moment
she forgot herself.&nbsp; She ran to the room where Lady Cantourne was
affixing the family jewelry on her dress, and, showing the letter, said
breathlessly that she must see Guy Oscard at once.&nbsp; Lady Cantourne,
wise woman of the world that she was, said nothing.&nbsp; She merely
finished her toilet, and, when the carriage was ready, they drove round
by Russell Square.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was it from?&rdquo; asked Millicent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From a person named Gordon, miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did it say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, miss, as I said before, I did not rightly see.&nbsp;
But it seems that it said, &lsquo;Come at once.&rsquo;&nbsp; I saw that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what else?&nbsp; Be quick, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think there was mention of somebody bein&rsquo; surrounded,
miss.&nbsp; Some name like Denver, I think.&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Wait a bit;
it wasn&rsquo;t that; it was somebody else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finishing off the port had also meant beginning it, and the worthy
butler&rsquo;s mind was not particularly clear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was there any mention of Mr. Oscard&rsquo;s partner, Mr.&mdash;eh&mdash;Meredith?&rdquo;
asked Millicent, glancing at the clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, miss, there was that name, but I don&rsquo;t rightly
remember in what connection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t say that he&mdash;&rdquo; Millicent paused
and drew in her breath with a jerk&mdash;&ldquo;was dead, or anything
like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&nbsp; I&mdash;am sorry we missed Mr. Oscard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned and went back to Lady Cantourne, who was sitting in the
carriage.&nbsp; And while she was dancing the second extra with the
first comer at four o&rsquo;clock the next morning, Guy Oscard was racing
out of Plymouth Sound into the teeth of a fine, driving rain.&nbsp;
On the bridge of the trembling tug-boat, by Oscard&rsquo;s side, stood
a keen-eyed Channel pilot, who knew the tracks of the steamers up and
down Channel as a gamekeeper knows the hare-tracks across a stubble-field.&nbsp;
Moreover, the tug-boat caught the big steamer pounding down into the
grey of the Atlantic Ocean, and in due time Guy Oscard landed on the
beach at Loango.</p>
<p>He had the telegram still in his pocket, and he went, not to Maurice
Gordon&rsquo;s office, but to the bungalow.</p>
<p>Jocelyn greeted him with a little inarticulate cry of joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not think that you could possibly be here so soon,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What news have you?&rdquo; he asked, without pausing to explain.&nbsp;
He was one of those men who are silenced by an unlimited capacity for
prompt action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; she replied, handing him the note written by
Jack Meredith to Marie at Msala.</p>
<p>Guy Oscard read it carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dated seven weeks last Monday&mdash;nearly two months ago,&rdquo;
he muttered, half to himself.</p>
<p>He raised his head and looked out of the window.&nbsp; There were
lines of anxiety round his eyes.&nbsp; Jocelyn never took her glance
from his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly two months ago,&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will go?&rdquo; she said&mdash;and something in her
voice startled him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I will go,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; He looked down
into her face with a vague question in his quiet eyes; and who knows
what he saw there?&nbsp; Perhaps she was off her guard.&nbsp; Perhaps
she read this man aright and did not care.</p>
<p>With a certain slow hesitation he laid his hand on her arm.&nbsp;
There was something almost paternal in his manner which was in keeping
with his stature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moreover,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I will get there in time.&nbsp;
I have an immense respect for Meredith.&nbsp; If he said that he could
hold out for four months, I should say that he could hold out for six.&nbsp;
There is no one like Meredith, once he makes up his mind to take things
seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not very well done, and she probably saw through it.&nbsp;
She probably knew that he was as anxious as she was herself.&nbsp; But
his very presence was full of comfort.&nbsp; It somehow brought a change
to the moral atmosphere&mdash;a sense of purposeful direct simplicity
which was new to the West African Coast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will send over to the factory for Maurice,&rdquo; said the
girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has been hard at work getting together your men.&nbsp;
If your telegram had not come he was going up to the Plateau himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oscard looked slightly surprised.&nbsp; That did not sound like Maurice
Gordon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you are almost capable of going yourself,&rdquo;
said the big man with a slow smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had been a man I should have been half-way there by this
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Durnovo?&rdquo; he asked suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe he is in Loango.&nbsp; He has not been to this house
for more than a fortnight; but Maurice has heard that he is still somewhere
in Loango.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jocelyn paused.&nbsp; There was an expression on Guy Oscard&rsquo;s
face which she rather liked, while it alarmed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not likely,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;that he will
come here.&nbsp; I&mdash;I rather lost my temper with him, and said
things which I imagine hurt his feelings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oscard nodded gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather afraid of doing that myself,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;only it will not be his feelings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;that it would be
at all expedient to say or do anything at present.&nbsp; He must go
with you to the Plateau.&nbsp; Afterwards&mdash;perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oscard laughed quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that sounds like one of Meredith&rsquo;s
propositions.&nbsp; But he does not mean it any more than you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do mean it,&rdquo; replied Jocelyn quietly.&nbsp; There
is no hatred so complete, so merciless, as the hatred of a woman for
one who has wronged the man she loves.&nbsp; At such times women do
not pause to give fair play.&nbsp; They make no allowance.</p>
<p>Jocelyn Gordon found a sort of fearful joy in the anger of this self-contained
Englishman.&nbsp; It was an unfathomed mine of possible punishment over
which she could in thought hold Victor Durnovo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;could be too mean&mdash;nothing
could be mean enough&mdash;to mete out to him in payment of his own
treachery and cowardice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went to a drawer in her writing-table and took from it an almanac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The letter you have in your hand,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;was
handed to Mr. Durnovo exactly a month ago by the woman at Msala.&nbsp;
From that time to this he has done nothing.&nbsp; He has simply abandoned
Mr. Meredith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is in Loango?&rdquo; inquired Oscard, with a premonitory
sense of enjoyment in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he know that you have sent for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Jocelyn.</p>
<p>Guy Oscard smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I will go and look for him,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>At dusk that same evening there was a singular incident in the bar-room
of the only hotel in Loango.</p>
<p>Victor Durnovo was there, surrounded by a few friends of antecedents
and blood similar to his own.&nbsp; They were having a convivial time
of it, and the consumption of whisky was greater than might be deemed
discreet in such a climate as that of Loango.</p>
<p>Durnovo was in the act of raising his glass to his lips when the
open doorway was darkened, and Guy Oscard stood before him.&nbsp; The
half-breed&rsquo;s jaw dropped; the glass was set down again rather
unsteadily on the zinc-covered counter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you,&rdquo; said Oscard.</p>
<p>There was a little pause, an ominous silence, and Victor Durnovo
slowly followed Oscard out of the room, leaving that ominous silence
behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I leave for Msala to-night,&rdquo; said Oscard, when they
were outside, &ldquo;and you are coming with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you damned first!&rdquo; replied Durnovo, with
a courage born of Irish whisky.</p>
<p>Guy Oscard said nothing, but he stretched out his right hand suddenly.&nbsp;
His fingers closed in the collar of Victor Durnovo&rsquo;s coat, and
that parti-coloured scion of two races found himself feebly trotting
through the one street of Loango.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Le&rsquo; go!&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
<p>But the hand at his neck neither relinquished nor contracted.&nbsp;
When they reached the beach the embarkation of the little army was going
forward under Maurice Gordon&rsquo;s supervision.&nbsp; Victor looked
at Gordon.&nbsp; He reflected over the trump card held in his hand,
but he was too skilful to play it then.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV.&nbsp; TO THE RESCUE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>I must mix myself with action lest
I wither by despair.</i></p>
<p>Jocelyn had not conveyed to her brother by word or hint the accusation
brought against him by Victor Durnovo.&nbsp; But when he returned home
it almost seemed as if he were conscious of the knowledge that was hers.&nbsp;
She thought she detected a subtle difference in his manner towards herself&mdash;something
apologetic and humble.&nbsp; This was really the result of Victor Durnovo&rsquo;s
threat made in the office of the factory long before.</p>
<p>Maurice Gordon was not the sort of man to carry through the burden
of a half-discovered secret.&nbsp; It needs a special temperament for
this&mdash;one that is able to inspire fear in whomsoever it may be
necessary to hold in check&mdash;a temperament with sufficient self-reliance
and strength to play an open game steadily through to the end.&nbsp;
Since Durnovo&rsquo;s plain-spoken threat had been uttered Gordon had
thought of little else, and it was well known that Jocelyn&rsquo;s influence
was all that prevented him from taking hopelessly to drink.&nbsp; When
away from her at the sub-factories it is to be feared that he gave way
to the temptation.&nbsp; There is nothing so wearing as a constant suspense,
a never-resting fear; and if a man knows that both may be relieved by
a slight over-indulgence he must be a strong man indeed if he can turn
aside.</p>
<p>Gordon betrayed himself to Jocelyn in a thousand little ways.&nbsp;
He consulted her wishes, deferred to her opinion, and sought her advice
in a way which never had been his hitherto; and while both were conscious
of this difference, both were alike afraid of seeking to explain it.</p>
<p>Jocelyn knew that her repulse of Victor Durnovo was only a temporary
advantage; the position could not remain long undecided.&nbsp; Victor
Durnovo would have to be met sooner or later.&nbsp; Each day increased
the strength of her conviction that her brother was in the power of
this man.&nbsp; Whether he had really allowed himself to be dragged
into the horrors of even a slight connection with the slave-trade she
could not tell; but she knew the world well enough to recognise the
fact that Durnovo had only to make the accusation for it to be believed
by the million sensation-mongers who are always on the alert for some
new horror.&nbsp; She knew that should Durnovo breathe a word of this
in the right quarter&mdash;that is to say, into the eager journalistic
ear&mdash;there would hardly be a civilised country in the world where
Maurice Gordon of Loango could dwell under his own name.&nbsp; She felt
that they were all living on a slumbering volcano.&nbsp; It was one
of those rare cases where human life seems no longer sacred; and this
refined, educated, gentle English lady found herself face to face with
the fact that Victor Durnovo&rsquo;s life would be cheap at the price
of her own.</p>
<p>At this moment Providence, with the wisdom of which we sometimes
catch a glimpse, laid another trouble upon her shoulders.&nbsp; While
she was half distracted with the thought of her brother&rsquo;s danger,
the news was put into her hand by the grinning N&acirc;la that Jack
Meredith&mdash;the man she openly in her own heart loved&mdash;was in
an even greater strait.</p>
<p>Here, at all events, was a peril that could be met, however heavy
might be the odds.&nbsp; Her own danger, the horror of Maurice&rsquo;s
crime, the hatred for Victor Durnovo, were all swallowed up in the sudden
call to help Jack Meredith.&nbsp; And Jocelyn found at least a saving
excitement in working night and day for the rescue of the man who was
to be Millicent Chyne&rsquo;s husband.</p>
<p>Maurice aided her loyally.&nbsp; His influence with the natives was
great; his knowledge of the country second only to Durnovo&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
During the fortnight that elapsed between the despatch of the telegram
to Guy Oscard and the arrival of that resourceful individual at Loango,
the whole coast was astir with preparation and excitement.&nbsp; Thus
it came about that Guy Oscard found a little army awaiting him, and
to Maurice Gordon was the credit given.&nbsp; Victor Durnovo simply
kept out of the way.&nbsp; The news that an expedition was being got
together to go to the relief of Jack Meredith never reached him in his
retreat.&nbsp; But after a fortnight spent in idleness in the neighbouring
interior, he could stand the suspense no longer, and came down into
the town, to be pounced upon at once by Guy Oscard.</p>
<p>As he stood on the beach near to Oscard, watching the embarkation
of the men, his feelings were decidedly mixed.&nbsp; There was an immense
relief from the anxiety of the last few weeks.&nbsp; He had stood on
the verge of many crimes, and had been forcibly dragged back therefrom
by the strong arm of Guy Oscard.&nbsp; It had been Victor Durnovo&rsquo;s
intention not only to abandon Jack Meredith to his certain fate, but
to appropriate to his own use the consignment of Simiacine, valued at
sixty thousand pounds, which he had brought down to the coast.&nbsp;
The end of it all was, of course, the possession of Jocelyn Gordon.&nbsp;
The programme was simple; but, racked as he was by anxiety, weakened
by incipient disease, and paralysed by chronic fear, the difficulties
were too great to be overcome.&nbsp; To be a thorough villain one must
possess, first of all, good health; secondly, untiring energy; and thirdly,
a certain enthusiasm for wrong-doing for its own sake.&nbsp; Criminals
of the first standard have always loved crime.&nbsp; Victor Durnovo
was not like that.&nbsp; He only made use of crime, and had no desire
to cultivate it for its own sake.&nbsp; To be forcibly dragged back,
therefore, into the paths of virtue was in some ways a great relief.&nbsp;
The presence of Guy Oscard, also, was in itself a comfort.&nbsp; Durnovo
felt that no responsibility attached itself to him; he had entire faith
in Oscard, and had only to obey.</p>
<p>Durnovo was not a person who suffered from too delicate a susceptibility.&nbsp;
The shame of his present position did not affect him deeply.&nbsp; Indeed,
he was one of those men who have no sense of shame before certain persons;
and Guy Oscard was one of those.&nbsp; The position was not in itself
one to be proud of, but the half-breed accepted it with wonderful equanimity,
and presently he began to assist in the embarkation.</p>
<p>It was nearly dark when the little coast steamer secured by Maurice
Gordon for the service turned her prow northward and steamed away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The truth is,&rdquo; Durnovo took an early opportunity of
saying to Oscard, &ldquo;that my nerve is no longer up to this work.&nbsp;
I should not care to undertake this business alone, despite my reputation
on the coast.&nbsp; It is a wonderful thing how closely the nerves are
allied to the state of one&rsquo;s health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; acquiesced Guy Oscard, with a lack of irony
which only made the irony keener.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been too long in this d----d country,&rdquo; exclaimed
Durnovo, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the fact.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not the man I
was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy Oscard smoked for some moments in silence; then he took his pipe
from his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only pity is,&rdquo; he said judicially, &ldquo;that you
ever undertook to look for the Simiacine if you were going to funk it
when the first difficulty arose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without further comment he walked away, and entered into conversation
with the captain of the steamer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; muttered Durnovo between his teeth&mdash;&ldquo;all
right, my sarcastic grand gentleman.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be even with you
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The strange part of it was that Guy Oscard never attempted to degrade
Durnovo from his post of joint commander.&nbsp; This puzzled the half-breed
sorely.&nbsp; It may have been that Oscard knew men better than his
indifferent manner would have led the observer to believe.&nbsp; Durnovo&rsquo;s
was just one of those natures which in good hands might have been turned
to good account.&nbsp; Too much solitude, too much dealing with negro
peoples, and, chiefly, too long a sojourn in the demoralising atmosphere
of West Africa, had made a worse man of Victor Durnovo than Nature originally
intended.&nbsp; He was not wholly bad.&nbsp; Badness is, after all,
a matter of comparison, and, in order to draw correctly such a comparison,
every allowance must be made for a difference in standard.&nbsp; Victor
Durnovo&rsquo;s standard was not a high one; that was all.&nbsp; And
in continuing to treat him as an equal, and trust him as such, Guy Oscard
only showed that he was a cleverer man than the world took him to be.</p>
<p>In due time Msala was reached.&nbsp; As the canoes suitable for up-river
traffic were by no means sufficient to transport the whole of the expeditionary
force in one journey, a division was made.&nbsp; Durnovo took charge
of the advance column, journeying up to the camp from which the long
march through the forest was to begin, and sending back the canoes for
Oscard and the remainder of the force.&nbsp; With these canoes he sent
back word that the hostile tribes were within a few days&rsquo; march,
and that he was fortifying his camp.</p>
<p>This news seemed to furnish Guy Oscard with food for considerable
thought, and after some space of time he called Marie.</p>
<p>She came, and, standing before him with her patient dignity of mien,
awaited his communications.&nbsp; She never took her eyes off the letter
in his hand.&nbsp; Oscard noticed the persistency of her gaze at the
time, and remembered it again afterwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have had rather serious news
from Mr. Durnovo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; rather breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will not be safe for you to stay at Msala&mdash;you must
take the children down to Loango.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he say that?&rdquo; she asked, in her rapid, indistinct
English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vic&mdash;Mr. Durnovo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Oscard, wondering at the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does not say anything about me or the children?&rdquo;
persisted Marie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet he says there is danger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a strange, angry look in her great dark eyes which Oscard
did not understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says that the tribes are within two days&rsquo; march of
his camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave an unpleasant little laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does not seem to have thought of us at Msala.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Oscard, folding the letter and putting
it in his pocket, &ldquo;that he thinks it is my duty to do what is
best for Msala.&nbsp; That is why I asked you to speak to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mario did not seem to be listening.&nbsp; She was looking over his
head up the river, in the direction from whence the message had come,
and there was a singular hopelessness in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot leave until he tells me to,&rdquo; she said doggedly.</p>
<p>Guy Oscard took the pipe from his lips and examined the bowl of it
attentively for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;but I insist on your
leaving with the children to-morrow.&nbsp; I will send two men down
with you, and will give you a letter to Miss Gordon, who will see to
your wants at Loango.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him with a sort of wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You insist?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>He raised his eyes to meet hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>She bowed her head in grave submission, and made a little movement
as if to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is chiefly on account of the children,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Quite suddenly she smiled, and seemed to check a sob in her throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she softly, &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
she went into the house.</p>
<p>The next morning brought further rumours of approaching danger, and
it seemed certain that this news must have filtered through Durnovo&rsquo;s
fortified camp further up the river.&nbsp; This time the report was
more definite.&nbsp; There were Arabs leading the tribes, and rumour
further stated that an organised descent on Msala was intended.&nbsp;
And yet there was no word from Durnovo&mdash;no sign to suggest that
he had even thought of securing the safety of his housekeeper and the
few aged negroes in charge of Msala.&nbsp; This news only strengthened
Oscard&rsquo;s determination to send Marie down to the coast, and he
personally superintended their departure before taking his seat in the
canoe for the up-river voyage.&nbsp; The men of his division had all
preceded him, and no one except his own boatmen knew that Msala was
to be abandoned.</p>
<p>There was in Guy Oscard a dogged sense of justice which sometimes
amounted to a cruel mercilessness.&nbsp; When he reached the camp he
deliberately withheld from Durnovo the news that the Msala household
had left the river station.&nbsp; Moreover, he allowed Victor Durnovo
to further inculpate himself.&nbsp; He led him on to discuss the position
of affairs, and the half-breed displayed an intimate knowledge of the
enemy&rsquo;s doings.&nbsp; There was only one inference to be drawn,
namely, that Victor Durnovo had abandoned his people at Msala with the
same deliberation which had characterised his cowardly faithlessness
to Jack Meredith.</p>
<p>Guy Oscard was a slow thinking man, although quick in action.&nbsp;
He pieced all these things together.&nbsp; The pieces did not seem to
fit just then&mdash;the construction was decidedly chaotic in its architecture.&nbsp;
But later on the corner-stone of knowledge propped up the edifice, and
everything slipped into its place.</p>
<p>Despite disquieting rumours, the expedition was allowed to depart
from the river-camp unmolested.&nbsp; For two days they marched through
the gloomy forest with all speed.&nbsp; On the third day one of the
men of Durnovo&rsquo;s division captured a native who had been prowling
on their heels in the line of march.&nbsp; Victor Durnovo sent captor
and prisoner to the front of the column, with a message to Oscard that
he would come presently and see what information was to be abstracted
from the captive.&nbsp; At the midday halt Durnovo accordingly joined
Oscard, and the man was brought before them.&nbsp; He was hardly worthy
of the name, so disease-stricken, so miserable and half-starved was
he.</p>
<p>At first Durnovo and he did not seem to be able to get to an understanding
at all; but presently they hit upon a dialect in which they possessed
a small common knowledge.</p>
<p>His news was not reassuring.&nbsp; In dealing with numbers he rarely
condescended to the use of less than four figures, and his conception
of a distance was very vague.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask him,&rdquo; said Oscard, &ldquo;whether he knows that
there is an Englishman with a large force on the top of a mountain far
to the east.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Durnovo translated, and the man answered with a smile.&nbsp; In reply
to some further question the negro launched into a detailed narrative,
to which Durnovo listened eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says,&rdquo; said the latter to Oscard, &ldquo;that the
Plateau is in possession of the Masais.&nbsp; It was taken two months
ago.&nbsp; The blacks were sold as slaves; the two Englishmen were tortured
to death and their bodies burnt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oscard never moved a muscle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask him if he is quite sure about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; replied Durnovo, after questioning.&nbsp; &ldquo;By
God! Oscard; what a pity!&nbsp; But I always knew it.&nbsp; I knew it
was quite hopeless from the first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He passed his brown hand nervously over his face, where the perspiration
stood in beads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Oscard slowly; &ldquo;but I think we will
go on all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Durnovo.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Guy Oscard; &ldquo;we will go on, and
if I find you trying to desert I&rsquo;ll shoot you down like a rat.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.&nbsp; IN PERIL</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>He made no sign; the fires of Hell
were round him,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pit of Hell below.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;About as bad as they can be, sir.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s how things
is.&rdquo;&nbsp; Joseph set down his master&rsquo;s breakfast on the
rough table that stood in front of his tent and looked at Jack Meredith.</p>
<p>Meredith had a way of performing most of his toilet outside his tent,
and while Joseph made his discouraging report he was engaged in buttoning
his waistcoat.&nbsp; He nodded gravely, but his manner was not that
of a man who fully realised his position of imminent danger.&nbsp; Some
men are like this&mdash;they die without getting at all flustered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not more nor two or three out of the whole lot
that I can put any trust in,&rdquo; continued Joseph.</p>
<p>Jack Meredith was putting on his coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what a barrack-room mutiny is.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve felt
it in the hatmosphere, so to speak, before now, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what does it feel like?&rdquo; inquired Jack Meredith,
lightly arranging his watch-chain.</p>
<p>But Joseph did not answer.&nbsp; He stepped backwards into the tent
and brought two rifles.&nbsp; There was no need of answer; for this
came in the sound of many voices, the clang and clatter of varied arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they come, sir,&rdquo; said the soldier-servant&mdash;respectful,
mindful of his place even at this moment.</p>
<p>Jack Meredith merely sat down behind the little table where his breakfast
stood untouched.&nbsp; He leant his elbow on the table and watched the
approach of the disorderly band of blacks.&nbsp; Some ran, some hung
back, but all were armed.</p>
<p>In front walked a small, truculent-looking man with broad shoulders
and an aggressive head.</p>
<p>He planted himself before Meredith, and turning, with a wave of the
hand, to indicate his followers, said in English:</p>
<p>&ldquo;These men&mdash;these friends of me&mdash;say they are tired
of you.&nbsp; You no good leader.&nbsp; They make me their leader.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders with a hideous grin of deprecation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I not want.&nbsp; They make me.&nbsp; We go to join our friends
in the valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed down into the valley where the enemy was encamped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have agreed to take two hundred pounds for you.&nbsp; Price
given by our friends in valley&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man stopped suddenly.&nbsp; He was looking into the muzzle of
a revolver with a fixed fascination.&nbsp; Jack Meredith exhibited no
haste.&nbsp; He did not seem yet to have realised the gravity of the
situation.&nbsp; He took very careful aim and pulled the trigger.&nbsp;
A little puff of white smoke floated over their heads.&nbsp; The broad-shouldered
man with the aggressive head looked stupidly surprised.&nbsp; He turned
towards his supporters with a pained look of inquiry, as if there was
something he did not quite understand, and then he fell on his face
and lay quite still.</p>
<p>Jack Meredith looked on the blank faces with a glance of urbane inquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has anybody else anything to say to me?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>There was a dead silence.&nbsp; Some one laughed rather feebly in
the background.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I think I will go on with my breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which he accordingly proceeded to do.</p>
<p>One or two of the mutineers dropped away and went back to their own
quarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it away,&rdquo; said Meredith, indicating the body of
the dead man with his teaspoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And look here,&rdquo; he cried out after them, &ldquo;do not
let us have any more of this nonsense!&nbsp; It will only lead to unpleasantness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the men grinned.&nbsp; They were not particularly respectful
in their manner of bearing away the mortal remains of their late leader.&nbsp;
The feeling had already turned.</p>
<p>Joseph thought fit to clench matters later on in the day by a few
remarks of his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the sort o&rsquo; man,&rdquo; he said, more in
resignation than in anger, &ldquo;that the guv&rsquo;nor is.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
quiet like and smooth-spoken, but when he does &lsquo;it he &lsquo;its
&rsquo;ard, and when he shoots he shoots mortal straight.&nbsp; Now,
what I says to you Christy Minstrels is this; we&rsquo;re all in the
same box and we all want the same thing, although I admit there&rsquo;s
a bit of a difference in our complexions.&nbsp; Some o&rsquo; you jokers
have got a fine richness of colour on your physiognimies that I don&rsquo;t
pretend to emulate.&nbsp; But no matter.&nbsp; What you wants is to
get out of this confounded old Platter, quick time, ain&rsquo;t it now?&mdash;to
get down to Loango and go out on the bust, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Christy Minstrels acquiesced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Joseph, &ldquo;obey orders and be hanged
to yer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It had been apparent to Meredith for some weeks past that the man
Nattoo, whom he had just shot, was bent on making trouble.&nbsp; His
prompt action had not, therefore, been the result of panic, but the
deliberate execution of a fore-ordained sentence.&nbsp; The only question
was how to make the necessary execution most awe-inspiring and exemplary.&nbsp;
The moment was well chosen, and served to strengthen, for the time being,
the waning authority of these two Englishmen thus thrown upon their
own resources in the heart of Africa.</p>
<p>The position was not a pleasant one.&nbsp; For three months the Plateau
had been surrounded by hostile tribes, who made desultory raids from
time to time.&nbsp; These, the little force on the summit was able to
repulse; but a combined attack from, say, two sides at once would certainly
have been successful.&nbsp; Meredith had no reason to suppose that his
appeal for help had reached Msala, infested as the intervening forests
were by cannibal tribes.&nbsp; Provisions were at a low ebb.&nbsp; There
seemed to be no hope of outside aid, and disaffection was rife in his
small force.&nbsp; Jack Meredith, who was no soldier, found himself
called upon to defend a weak position, with unreliable men, for an indefinite
period.</p>
<p>Joseph had a rough knowledge of soldiering and a very rudimentary
notion of fortification.&nbsp; But he had that which served as well&mdash;the
unerring eye for covert of a marksman.&nbsp; He was a dead shot at any
range, and knowing what he could hit he also knew how to screen himself
from the rifle of an enemy.</p>
<p>Above all, perhaps, was the quiet influence of a man who never flinched
from danger nor seemed to be in the least disconcerted by its presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems, sir,&rdquo; said Joseph to his master later in the
day, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;ve kinder stumped them.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t
understand you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must be kept in check by fear.&nbsp; There is no other
way,&rdquo; replied Meredith rather wearily.&nbsp; Of late he had felt
less and less inclined to exert himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&nbsp; Those sort o&rsquo; men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meredith made no answer, and after a little pause Joseph repeated
the words significantly, if ungrammatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those sort o&rsquo; men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slaves,&rdquo; replied Joseph sharply, touching his hat without
knowing why.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slaves!&nbsp; What the devil are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man came a little nearer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those forty men&mdash;leastwise thirty-four men&mdash;that
we brought from Msala&mdash;Mr. Durnovo&rsquo;s men, that cultivate
this &rsquo;ere Simiacine as they call it&mdash;they&rsquo;re different
from the rest, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course they are.&nbsp; We do not hire them direct&mdash;we
hire them from Mr. Durnovo and pay their wages to him.&nbsp; They are
of a different tribe from the others&mdash;not fighting men but agriculturists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;&rdquo; Joseph paused.&nbsp; &ldquo;Strange thing,
sir, but I&rsquo;ve not seen &rsquo;em handling any of their pay yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that is their affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yessir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having unburthened himself of his suspicion, the servant retired,
shaking his head ominously.&nbsp; At any other time the words just recorded
would have aroused Jack Meredith&rsquo;s attention, but the singular
slothfulness that seemed to be creeping over his intellect was already
acting as a clog on his mental energy.</p>
<p>The next morning he was unable to leave his bed, and lay all day
in a state of semi-somnolence.&nbsp; Joseph explained to the men that
the leader was so disgusted with their ungrateful conduct that he would
not leave the tent.&nbsp; In the evening there was a slight attack made
from the southern side.&nbsp; This Joseph was able to repulse, chiefly
by his own long-range firing, assisted by a few picked rifles.&nbsp;
But the situation was extremely critical.&nbsp; The roll of the big
war-drum could be heard almost incessantly, rising with weird melancholy
from the forest land beneath them.</p>
<p>Despite difficulties the new crop of Simiacine&mdash;the second within
twelve months&mdash;had been picked, dried, and stored in cases.&nbsp;
Without, on the Plateau, stood the bare trees, affording no covert for
savage warfare&mdash;no screen against the deadly bullet.&nbsp; The
camp was placed near one edge of the tableland, and on this exposed
side the stockade was wisely constructed of double strength.&nbsp; The
attacks had hitherto been made only from this side, but Joseph knew
that anything in the nature of a combined assault would carry his defence
before it.&nbsp; In his rough-and-ready way he doctored his master,
making for him such soups and strength-giving food as he could.&nbsp;
Once, very late in the night, when it almost seemed that the shadow
of death lay over the little tent, he pounded up some of the magic Simiacine
leaves and mixed them in the brandy which he administered from time
to time.</p>
<p>Before sunrise the next morning the alarm was given again, and the
little garrison was called to arms.</p>
<p>When Joseph left his master&rsquo;s tent he was convinced that neither
of them had long to live; but he was of that hard material which is
found in its very best form in the ranks and on the forecastle&mdash;men
who die swearing.&nbsp; It may be very reprehensible&mdash;no doubt
it is&mdash;but it is very difficult for a plain-going man to withhold
his admiration for such as these.&nbsp; It shows, at all events, that
Thomas Atkins and Jack are alike unafraid of meeting their Maker.&nbsp;
It is their duty to fight either a living enemy or a cruel sea, and
if a little profanity helps them to their duty, who are we that we may
condemn them?</p>
<p>So Joseph went out with a rifle in each hand and a fine selection
of epithets on his tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you devils,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re just going
to fight like hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And what else he said it booteth little.</p>
<p>He took his station on the roof of a hut in the centre of the little
stockade, and from thence he directed the fire of his men.&nbsp; Crouching
beneath him he had a disabled native who loaded each rifle in turn;
and just by way of encouraging the others he picked off the prominent
men outside the stockade with a deadly steadiness.&nbsp; By way of relieving
the tension he indulged in an occasional pleasantry at the expense of
the enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a man lookin&rsquo;
over that bush with a green feather on his nut.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a mistake
to wear green feathers; it makes a body so conspicuous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the wearer of the obnoxious feather would throw up his arms and
topple backwards, down the hill.</p>
<p>If Joseph detected anything like cowardice or carelessness he pointed
his rifle with a threatening frown towards the culprit, with instant
effect.&nbsp; Presently, however, things began to get more serious.&nbsp;
This was not the sudden assault of a single chief, but an organised
attack.&nbsp; Before long Joseph ceased to smile.&nbsp; By sunrise he
was off the roof, running from one weak point to another, encouraging,
threatening, fighting, and swearing very hard.&nbsp; More than once
the enemy reached the stockade, and&mdash;ominous sign&mdash;one or
two of their dead lay inside the defence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fight, yer devils&mdash;fight!&rdquo; he cried in a hoarse
whisper, for his voice had given way.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hell&mdash;give &rsquo;em
hell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was everywhere at once, urging on his men, kicking them, pushing
them, forcing them up to the stockade.&nbsp; But he saw the end.&nbsp;
Half-dazed, the blacks fought on in silence.&nbsp; The grim African
sun leapt up above the distant line of forest and shone upon one of
the finest sights to be seen on earth&mdash;a soldier wounded, driven,
desperate, and not afraid.</p>
<p>In the midst of it a hand was laid on Joseph&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; cried a voice, &ldquo;<i>that</i> corner.&nbsp;
See to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without looking round, Joseph obeyed, and the breached corner was
saved.&nbsp; He only knew that his master, who was almost dead, had
come to life again.&nbsp; There was no time for anything else.</p>
<p>For half an hour it was a question of any moment.&nbsp; Master and
man were for the time being nothing better than madmen, and the fighting
frenzy is wildly infectious.</p>
<p>At last there was a pause.&nbsp; The enemy fell back, and in the
momentary silence the sound of distant firing reached the ears of the
little band of defenders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Meredith sharply.&nbsp; He
looked like one risen from the dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fighting among themselves,&rdquo; replied Joseph, who was
wiping blood and grime from his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then one of them is fighting with an Express rifle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joseph listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By God!&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;by God, Mer&mdash;sir, we&rsquo;re
saved!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The enemy had apparently heard the firing too.&nbsp; Perhaps they
also recognised the peculiar sharp &ldquo;smack&rdquo; of the Express
rifle amidst the others.&nbsp; There was a fresh attack&mdash;an ugly
rush of reckless men.&nbsp; But the news soon spread that there was
firing in the valley and the sound of a white man&rsquo;s rifle.&nbsp;
The little garrison plucked up heart, and the rifles, almost too hot
to hold, dealt death around.</p>
<p>They held back the savages until the sound of the firing behind them
was quite audible even amidst the heavy rattle of the musketry.</p>
<p>Then suddenly the firing ceased&mdash;the enemy had divided and fled.&nbsp;
For a few moments there was a strange, tense silence.&nbsp; Then a voice&mdash;an
English voice&mdash;cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment Guy Oscard stood on the edge of the Plateau.&nbsp;
He held up both arms as a signal to those within the stockade to cease
firing, and then he came forward, followed by a number of blacks and
Durnovo.</p>
<p>The gate was rapidly disencumbered of its rough supports and thrown
open.</p>
<p>Jack Meredith stood in the aperture, holding out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right; it&rsquo;s&mdash;all right,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>Oscard did not seem to take so cheerful a view of matters.&nbsp;
He scrutinised Meredith&rsquo;s face with visible anxiety.</p>
<p>Then suddenly Jack lurched up against his rescuer, grabbing at him
vaguely.</p>
<p>In a minute Oscard was supporting him back towards his tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, you know,&rdquo; explained Jack Meredith
very gravely; &ldquo;I am a bit weak&mdash;that is all.&nbsp; I am hungry&mdash;haven&rsquo;t
had anything to eat for some time, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Oscard shortly; &ldquo;I know all about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.&nbsp; OFF DUTY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Chacun de vous peut-&ecirc;tre en
son coeur solitaire<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sous des ris
passagers &eacute;touffe un long regret.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye to that damned old Platter&mdash;may it be for ever!&rdquo;&nbsp;
With this valedictory remark Joseph shook his fist once more at the
unmoved mountain and resumed his march.</p>
<p>&ldquo;William,&rdquo; he continued gravely to a native porter who
walked at his side and knew no word of English, &ldquo;there is some
money that is not worth the making.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man grinned from ear to ear and nodded with a vast appreciation
of what experience taught him to take as a joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember that, my black diamond, and just mind the corner
of your mouth don&rsquo;t get hitched over yer ear,&rdquo; said Joseph,
patting him with friendly cheerfulness.</p>
<p>Then he made his way forward to walk by the side of his master&rsquo;s
litter and encourage the carriers with that mixture of light badinage
and heavy swearing which composed his method of dealing with the natives.</p>
<p>Three days after the arrival of the rescuing force at the Plateau,
Guy Oscard had organised a retreating party, commanded by Joseph, to
convey Jack Meredith down to the coast.&nbsp; He knew enough of medicine
to recognise the fact that this was no passing indisposition, but a
thorough breakdown in health.&nbsp; The work and anxiety of the last
year, added to the strange disquieting breath of the Simiacine grove,
had brought about a serious collapse in the system which only months
of rest and freedom from care could repair.</p>
<p>Before the retreating column was ready to march it was discovered
that the hostile tribes had finally evacuated the country; which deliverance
was brought about not by Oscard&rsquo;s blood-stained track through
the forest, not by the desperate defence of the Plateau, but by the
whisper that Victor Durnovo was with them.&nbsp; Truly a man&rsquo;s
reputation is a strange thing.</p>
<p>And this man&mdash;the mighty warrior whose name was as good as an
army in Central Africa&mdash;went down on his knees one night to Guy
Oscard, imploring him to abandon the Simiacine Plateau, or at all events
to allow him to go down to Loango with Meredith and Joseph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Oscard; &ldquo;Meredith held this place for
us when he could have left it safely.&nbsp; He has held it for a year.&nbsp;
It is our turn now.&nbsp; We will hold it for him.&nbsp; I am going
to stay, and you have to stay with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For Jack Meredith, life was at this time nothing but a constant,
never-ceasing fatigue.&nbsp; When Oscard helped him into the rough litter
they had constructed for his comfort, he laid his head on the pillow,
overcome with a dead sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, old chap,&rdquo; said Oscard, patting him on the
shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;G&rsquo;bye;&rdquo; and Jack Meredith turned over on his side
as if he were in bed, drew up the blanket, and closed his eyes.&nbsp;
He did not seem to know where he was, and, what was worse, he did not
seem to care.&nbsp; Oscard gave the signal to the bearers, and the march
began.&nbsp; There is something in the spring of human muscles unlike
any other motive power; the power of thought may be felt even on the
pole of a litter, and one thing that modern invention can never equal
is the comfort of being carried on the human shoulder.&nbsp; The slow
swinging movement came to be a part of Jack Meredith&rsquo;s life&mdash;indeed,
life itself seemed to be nothing but a huge journey thus peacefully
accomplished.&nbsp; Through the flapping curtains an endless procession
of trees passed before his half-closed eyes.&nbsp; The unintelligible
gabble of the light-hearted bearers of his litter was all that reached
his ears.&nbsp; And ever at his side was Joseph&mdash;cheerful, indefatigable,
resourceful.&nbsp; There was in his mind one of the greatest happinesses
of life&mdash;the sense of something satisfactorily accomplished&mdash;the
peacefulness that comes when the necessity for effort is past and left
behind&mdash;that lying down to rest which must surely be something
like Death in its kindest form.</p>
<p>The awe inspired by Victor Durnovo&rsquo;s name went before the little
caravan like a moral convoy and cleared their path.&nbsp; Thus guarded
by the name of a man whom he hated, Jack Meredith was enabled to pass
through a savage country literally cast upon a bed of sickness.</p>
<p>In due course the river was reached, and the gentle swing of the
litter was changed for the smoother motion of the canoe.&nbsp; And it
was at this period of the journey&mdash;in the forced restfulness of
body entailed&mdash;that Joseph&rsquo;s mind soared to higher things,
and he determined to write a letter to Sir John.</p>
<p>He was, he admitted even to himself, no great penman, and his epistolary
style tended, perhaps, more to the forcible than to the finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somethin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;that&rsquo;ll
just curl his back hair for &rsquo;im; that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll
write &rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Msala had been devastated, and it was within the roofless walls of
Durnovo&rsquo;s house that Joseph finally wrote out laboriously the
projected capillary invigorator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;HONOURED SIR&rdquo; (he wrote),&mdash;&ldquo;Trusting you
will excuse the liberty, I take up my pen to advise you respectfully&rdquo;&mdash;while
writing this word Joseph closed his left eye&mdash;&ldquo;that my master
is taken seriously worse.&nbsp; Having been on the sick-list now for
a matter of five weeks, he just lies on his bed as weak as a new-born
babe, as the sayin&rsquo; is, and doesn&rsquo;t take no notice of nothing.&nbsp;
I have succeeded in bringing him down to the coast, which we hope to
reach to-morrow, and when we get to Loango&mdash;a poor sort of place&mdash;I
shall at once obtain the best advice obtainable&mdash;that is to be
had.&nbsp; Howsoever, I may have to send for it; but money being no
object to either master or me, respectfully I beg to say that every
care will be took.&nbsp; Master having kind friends at Loango, I have
no anxiety as to the future, but, honoured sir, it has been a near touch
in the past&mdash;just touch and go, so to speak.&nbsp; Not being in
a position to form a estimate of what is the matter with master, I can
only respectfully mention that I take it to be a general kerlapse of
the system, brought on, no doubt, by too long a living in the unhealthy
platters of Central Africa.&nbsp; When I gets him to Loango I shall
go straight to the house of Mr. and Miss Gordon, where we stayed before,
and with no fear but what we will be received with every kindness and
the greatest hospitality.&nbsp; Thank God, honoured sir, I&rsquo;ve
kept my health and strength wonderful, and am therefore more able to
look after master.&nbsp; When we reach Loango I shall ask Miss Gordon
kindly to write to you, sir, seeing as I have no great facility with
my pen.&mdash;I am, honoured sir, your respectful servant to command,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;JOSEPH
ATKINSON,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Late
Corporal 217th Regt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were one or two round splashes on the paper suggestive, perhaps,
of tears, but not indicative of those useless tributes.&nbsp; The truth
was that it was a hot evening, and Joseph had, as he confessed, but
little facility with the pen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said the scribe, with a smile of intense satisfaction.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That will give the old &rsquo;un beans.&nbsp; Not that I don&rsquo;t
respect him&mdash;oh no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, and gazed thoughtfully at the evening star.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange thing&mdash;life,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;uncommon
strange.&nbsp; Perhaps the old &rsquo;un is right; there&rsquo;s no
knowin&rsquo;.&nbsp; The ways o&rsquo; Providence <i>are</i> mysterious&mdash;onnecessarily
mysterious to my thinkin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he shook his head at the evening star, as if he was not quite
pleased with it.</p>
<p>With a feeling of considerable satisfaction, Joseph approached the
Bungalow at Loango three days later.&nbsp; The short sea voyage had
somewhat revived Meredith, who had been desirous of walking up from
the beach, but after a short attempt had been compelled to enter the
spring cart which Joseph had secured.</p>
<p>Joseph walked by the side of this cart with an erect carriage, and
a suppressed importance suggestive of ambulance duty in the old days.</p>
<p>As the somewhat melancholy <i>cort&egrave;ge</i> approached the house,
Meredith drew back the dusky brown holland curtain and looked anxiously
out.&nbsp; Nor were Joseph&rsquo;s eyes devoid of expectation.&nbsp;
He thought that Jocelyn would presently emerge from the flower-hung
trellis of the verandah; and he had rehearsed over and over again a
neat, respectful speech, explanatory of his action in bringing a sick
man to the house.</p>
<p>But the hanging fronds of flowers and leaf remained motionless, and
the cart drove, unchallenged, round to the principal door.</p>
<p>A black servant&mdash;a stranger&mdash;held the handle, and stood
back invitingly.&nbsp; Supported by Joseph&rsquo;s arm, Jack Meredith
entered.&nbsp; The servant threw open the drawing-room door; they passed
in.&nbsp; The room was empty.&nbsp; On the table lay two letters, one
addressed to Guy Oscard, the other to Jack Meredith.&nbsp; Meredith
felt suddenly how weak he was, and sat wearily down on the sofa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me that letter,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Joseph looked at him keenly.&nbsp; There was something forlorn and
cold about the room&mdash;about the whole house&mdash;with the silent,
smiling, black servants and the shaded windows.</p>
<p>Joseph handed the letter as desired, and then, with quick practised
hands, he poured a small quantity of brandy into the cup of his flask.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Drink this first, sir,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Jack Meredith fumbled rather feebly at the letter.&nbsp; It was distinctly
an effort to him to tear the paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;MY DEAR MEREDITH&rdquo; (he read),&mdash;&ldquo;Just a line
to tell you that the Bungalow and its contents are at your service.&nbsp;
Jocelyn and I are off home for two months&rsquo; change of air.&nbsp;
I have been a bit seedy.&nbsp; I leave this at the Bungalow, and we
shall feel hurt if you do not make the house your home whenever you
happen to come down to Loango.&nbsp; I have left a similar note for
Oscard, in whose expedition to your relief I have all faith.&mdash;Yours
ever,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;MAURICE
GORDON.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Meredith to his servant, &ldquo;you may
as well read it for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He handed the letter to Joseph and leant back with a strange rapidity
of movement on the sofa.&nbsp; As he lay there with his eyes closed
he looked remarkably like a dead man.</p>
<p>While Joseph was reading the letter the sound of bare feet on the
cocoa-leaf matting made him turn round.</p>
<p>A small, rotund white figure of a child, clad in a cotton garment,
stood in the doorway, finger in mouth, gazing gravely at the two occupants
of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nestorius!&rdquo; exclaimed Joseph, &ldquo;by all that&rsquo;s
holy!&nbsp; Well, I <i>am</i> glad to see you, my son.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s
Mammy, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nestorius turned gravely round and pointed a small dusky finger in
the direction of the servants&rsquo; quarters.&nbsp; Then he replaced
the finger between his lips and came slowly forward to examine Meredith,
who had opened his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, stout Nestorius.&nbsp; This is a bad case, is it not?&rdquo;
said the sick man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad case,&rdquo; repeated Nestorius mechanically.</p>
<p>At that moment Marie came into the room, dignified, gentle, self-possessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, missis,&rdquo; said Joseph, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see
you.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re wanted badly, and that&rsquo;s the truth.&nbsp;
Mr. Meredith&rsquo;s not at all well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie bowed gravely.&nbsp; She went to Meredith&rsquo;s side, and
looked at him with a smile that was at once critical and encouraging.&nbsp;
Nestorius holding on to her skirts looked up to her face, and seeing
the smile, smiled too.&nbsp; He went further.&nbsp; He turned and smiled
at Joseph as if to make things pleasant all round.</p>
<p>Marie stooped over the sofa and her clever dusky fingers moved to
the cushions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be better in bed,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I will
get Mr. Gordon&rsquo;s room made ready for you&mdash;yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are occasions when the mere presence of a woman supplies a
distinct want.&nbsp; She need not be clever, or very capable; she need
have no great learning or experience.&nbsp; She merely has to be a woman&mdash;the
more womanly the better.&nbsp; There are times when a man may actually
be afraid for the want of a woman, but that is usually for the want
of one particular woman.&nbsp; There may be a distinct sense of fear&mdash;a
fear of life and its possibilities&mdash;which is nothing else than
a want&mdash;the want of a certain voice, the desire to be touched by
a certain hand, the carping necessity (which takes the physical form
of a pressure deep down in the throat) for the sympathy of that one
person whose presence is different from the presence of other people.&nbsp;
And failing that particular woman another can, in a certain degree,
by her mere womanliness, stay the pressure of the want.</p>
<p>This was what Marie did for Jack Meredith, by coming into the room
and bending over him and touching his cushions with a sort of deftness
and <i>savoir-faire</i>.&nbsp; He did not define his feelings&mdash;he
was too weak for that; but he had been conscious, for the first time
in his life, of a distinct sense of fear when he read Maurice Gordon&rsquo;s
letter.&nbsp; Of course he had thought of the possibility of death many
times during the last five weeks; but he had no intention of dying.&nbsp;
He set the fact plainly before himself that with care he might recover,
but that at any moment some symptom could declare itself which would
mean death.</p>
<p>Both he and Joseph had, without making mention of it to each other,
counted entirely on finding the Gordons at home.&nbsp; It was more than
a disappointment&mdash;very much more for Jack Meredith.&nbsp; But in
real life we do not analyse our feelings as do men in books&mdash;more
especially books of the mawko-religious tenor written by ladies.&nbsp;
Jack Meredith only knew that he felt suddenly afraid of dying when he
read Maurice Gordon&rsquo;s letter, and that when the half-caste woman
came into the room and gently asserted her claim, as it were, to supreme
authority in this situation, the fear seemed to be allayed.</p>
<p>Joseph, with something bright glistening in his keen, quick eyes,
stood watching his face as if for a verdict.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are tired,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;after your long journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she turned to Joseph with that soft, natural way which seems
to run through the negro blood, however much it may be diluted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help Mr. Meredith,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to Mr. Gordon&rsquo;s
room.&nbsp; I will go at once and see that the bed is prepared.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.&nbsp; A SLOW RECOVERY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>We dare not let our tears flow,
lest, in truth,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They fall upon our
work which must be done.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;They was just in time,&rdquo; said Joseph pleasantly to Marie
that same evening, when Jack Meredith had been made comfortable for
the night, and there was time to spare for supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; replied the woman, who was busy with the supper-table.</p>
<p>Joseph glanced at her keenly.&nbsp; The exclamation not only displayed
a due interest, but contained many questions.&nbsp; He stretched out
his legs and wagged his head sapiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no mistake!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;They timed it
almost to the minute.&nbsp; We had sort of beaten them back for the
time bein&rsquo;.&nbsp; Mr. Meredith had woke up sudden, as I told you,
and came into the thick of the <i>melee</i>, as we say in the service.&nbsp;
Then we heard the firin&rsquo; in the distance and the &lsquo;splat&rsquo;
of Mr. Oscard&rsquo;s Express rifle.&nbsp; I just turns, like this &rsquo;ere,
my head over me shoulder, quite confidential, and I says, &lsquo;Good
Lord, I thank yer.&rsquo;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m no hand at tracts and Bible-readin&rsquo;s,
but I&rsquo;m not such a blamed fool, Mistress Marie, as to think that
this &rsquo;ere rum-go of a world made itself.&nbsp; No, not quite.&nbsp;
So I just put in a word, quiet-like, to the Creator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie was setting before him such luxuries as she could command.&nbsp;
She nodded encouragingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheddar cheese,&rdquo; he said parenthetically, with an appreciative
sniff.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hav&rsquo;n&rsquo;t seen a bit o&rsquo; that for
a long time!&nbsp; Well, then, up comes Mr. Oscard as cool as a cowcumber,
and Mr. Meredith he gives a sort of little laugh and says, &lsquo;Open
that gate.&rsquo;&nbsp; Quite quiet, yer know.&nbsp; No high falutin&rsquo;
and potry and that.&nbsp; A few minutes before he had been fightin&rsquo;
and cussin&rsquo; and shoutin&rsquo;, just like any Johnny in the ranks.&nbsp;
Then he calms down and wipes the blood off&rsquo;n his hand on the side
of his pants, and says, &lsquo;Open that gate.&rsquo;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
a nice piece of butter you&rsquo;ve got there, mistress.&nbsp; Lord!
it&rsquo;s strange I never missed all them things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring your chair to the table,&rdquo; said Marie, &ldquo;and
begin.&nbsp; You are hungry&mdash;yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hungry ain&rsquo;t quite the word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have some mutton&mdash;yes?&nbsp; And Mr. Durnovo,
where was he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joseph bent over his plate, with elbows well out, wielding his knife
and fork with a more obvious sense of enjoyment than usually obtains
in the politer circles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Durnovo,&rdquo; he said, with one quick glance towards
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, he was just behind Mr. Oscard.&nbsp; And he follows
&rsquo;im, and we all shake hands just as if we was meeting in the Row,
except that most of our hands was a bit grimy and sticky-like with blood
and grease off&rsquo;n the cartridges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; said Marie, in an indirectly interrogative way,
as she helped him to a piece of sweet potato, &ldquo;you were glad to
see them, Mr. Oscard and Mr. Durnovo&mdash;yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad ain&rsquo;t quite the word,&rdquo; replied Joseph, with
his mouth full.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they were not hurt or&mdash;ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; returned Joseph, with another quick glance.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They were all right.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t like sitting here
and eatin&rsquo; while you don&rsquo;t take bit or sup yourself.&nbsp;
Won&rsquo;t you chip in, Mistress Marie?&nbsp; Come now, do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With her deep, patient smile she obeyed him, eating little and carelessly,
like a woman in some distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will they come down to Loango?&rdquo; she asked suddenly,
without looking at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! that I can&rsquo;t tell you.&nbsp; We left quite in a
hurry, as one may say, with nothin&rsquo; arranged.&nbsp; Truth is I
think we all feared that the guv&rsquo;nor had got his route.&nbsp;
He looked very like peggin&rsquo; out, and that&rsquo;s the truth.&nbsp;
Howsomever, I hope for the best now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie said nothing, merely contenting herself with attending to his
wants, which were numerous and frequent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That God-forsaken place, Msala,&rdquo; said Joseph presently,
&ldquo;has been rather crumpled up by the enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have destroyed it&mdash;yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re right, they <i>&rsquo;ave</i>
destroyed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie gave a quick little sigh&mdash;one of those sighs which the
worldly-wise recognise at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem over-pleased,&rdquo; said Joseph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was very happy there,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>Joseph leant back in his chair, fingering reflectively his beer-glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, mistress,&rdquo; he said half-shyly, &ldquo;that
your life can&rsquo;t have been a very happy one.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
some folk that is like that&mdash;through no fault of their own, too,
so far as our mortal vision, so to speak, can reckon it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have my troubles, like other people,&rdquo; she answered
softly.</p>
<p>Joseph inclined his head to one side and collected his breadcrumbs
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always seems to me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that your married
life can&rsquo;t have been so happy-like as&mdash;well, as one might
say, you deserved, missis.&nbsp; But then you&rsquo;ve got them clever
little kids.&nbsp; I <i>do</i> like them little kids wonderful.&nbsp;
Not bein&rsquo; a marrying man myself, I don&rsquo;t know much of such
matters.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ve always understood that little &rsquo;uns&mdash;especially
cunning little souls like yours&mdash;go a long way towards makin&rsquo;
up a woman&rsquo;s happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she murmured, with her slow smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been dead long&mdash;their pa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;beg pardon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Joseph drowned a very proper confusion in bitter beer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has only ceased to care about me&mdash;or his children,&rdquo;
explained Marie.</p>
<p>Joseph shook his head; but whether denial of such a possibility was
intended, or an expression of sympathy, he did not explain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; he said, with a somewhat laboured change of
manner, &ldquo;that the little ones are in good health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joseph pushed back his chair with considerable vigour, and passed
the back of his hand convivially across his moustache.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A square meal I call that,&rdquo; he said, with a pleasant
laugh, &ldquo;and I thank you kindly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a tact which is sometimes found wanting inside a better coat
than he possessed, Joseph never again referred to that part of Marie&rsquo;s
life which seemed to hang like a shadow over her being.&nbsp; Instead,
he set himself the task of driving away the dull sense of care which
was hers, and he succeeded so well that Jack Meredith, lying between
sleep and death in his bedroom, sometimes heard a new strange laugh.</p>
<p>By daybreak next morning Joseph was at sea again, steaming south
in a coasting-boat towards St. Paul de Loanda.&nbsp; He sent off a telegram
to Maurice Gordon in England, announcing the success of the Relief Expedition,
and then proceeded to secure the entire services of a medical man.&nbsp;
With this youthful disciple of &AElig;sculapius he returned forthwith
to Loango and settled down with characteristic energy to nurse his master.</p>
<p>Meredith&rsquo;s progress was lamentably slow, but still it was progress,
and in the right direction.&nbsp; The doctor, who was wise in the strange
maladies of the West Coast, stayed for two days, and promised to return
once a week.&nbsp; He left full instructions, and particularly impressed
upon the two nurses the fact that the recovery would necessarily be
so slow that their unpractised eyes could hardly expect to trace its
progress.</p>
<p>It is just possible that Meredith could at this time have had no
better nurse than Joseph.&nbsp; There was a military discipline about
the man&rsquo;s method which was worth more than much feminine persuasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beef tea, sir,&rdquo; he would announce with a face of wood,
for the sixth time in one day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, again?&nbsp; No, hang it!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them&rsquo;s my orders, sir,&rdquo; was Joseph&rsquo;s invariable
reply, and he was usually in a position to produce documentary confirmation
of his statement.&nbsp; The two men&mdash;master and servant&mdash;had
grown so accustomed to the military discipline of a besieged garrison
that it did not seem to occur to them to question the doctor&rsquo;s
orders.</p>
<p>Nestorius&mdash;small, stout, and silent&mdash;was a frequenter of
the sick-room, by desire of the invalid.&nbsp; After laboriously toiling
up the shallow stairs&mdash;a work entailing huge effort of limbs and
chin&mdash;he would stump gravely into the room without any form of
salutation.&nbsp; There are some great minds above such trifles.&nbsp;
His examination of the patient was a matter of some minutes.&nbsp; Then
he would say, &ldquo;Bad case,&rdquo; with the peculiar mechanical diction
that was his&mdash;the words that Meredith had taught him on the evening
of his arrival.&nbsp; After making his diagnosis Nestorius usually proceeded
to entertain the patient with a display of his treasures for the time
being.&nbsp; These were not in themselves of great value: sundry pebbles,
a trouser-button, two shells, and a glass stopper, formed, as it were,
the basis of his collection, which was increased or diminished according
to circumstances.&nbsp; Some of these he named; others were exhibited
with a single adjective, uttered curtly, as between men who required
no great tale of words wherewith to understand each other.&nbsp; A few
were considered to be of sufficient value and importance to tell their
own story and make their way in the world thereupon.&nbsp; He held these
out with a face of grave and contemplative patronage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, Nestorius,&rdquo; Meredith would say gravely, &ldquo;in
the course of a long and varied experience, have I seen a Worcester-sauce
stopper of such transcendent beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sometimes Nestorius clambered on to the bed, when the mosquito-curtains
were up, and rested from his labours&mdash;a small curled-up form, looking
very comfortable.&nbsp; And then, when his mother&rsquo;s soft voice
called him, he was wont to gather up his belongings and take his departure.&nbsp;
On the threshold he always paused, finger in mouth, to utter a valedictory
&ldquo;Bad case&rdquo; before making his way downstairs with a shadowy,
mystic smile.</p>
<p>Kind neighbours called, and well-meaning but mistaken dissenting
missionaries left religious works of a morbid nature, eminently suitable
to the sick-bed; but Joseph, Marie, and Nestorius were the only three
who had free access to the quiet room.</p>
<p>And all the while the rain fell&mdash;night and day, morning, noon,
and evening&mdash;as if the flood-gates had been left open by mistake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sloobrious, no doubt,&rdquo; said Joseph, &ldquo;but blamed
depressing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he shook his head at the lowering sky with a tolerant smile,
which was his way of taking Providence to task.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do y&rsquo; know what I would like, missis?&rdquo; he asked
briskly of Marie one evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d like to clap my eyes on Miss Gordon, just
a stepping in at that open door&mdash;that&rsquo;s what we want.&nbsp;
That sawbones feller is right when he says the progress will be slow.&nbsp;
Slow!&nbsp; Slow ain&rsquo;t quite the word.&nbsp; No more ain&rsquo;t
progress the word&mdash;that&rsquo;s my opinion.&nbsp; He just lies
on that bed, and the most he can do is to skylark a bit with Nestorius.&nbsp;
He don&rsquo;t take no interest in nothin&rsquo;, least of all in his
victuals&mdash;and a man&rsquo;s in a bad way when he takes no interest
in his victuals.&nbsp; Yes, I&rsquo;ll take another pancake, thankin&rsquo;
you kindly.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got a rare light hand for pancakes.&nbsp;
Rare&mdash;rare ain&rsquo;t quite the word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what could Miss Gordon do?&rdquo; asked Marie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she could kinder interest him in things&mdash;don&rsquo;t
you see?&nbsp; Him and I we ain&rsquo;t got much in common&mdash;except
his clothes and that confounded beef-tea and slushin&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
And then there&rsquo;s Mr. Gordon.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a good hearty sort,
he is.&nbsp; Comes galamphin&rsquo; into the room, kickin&rsquo; a couple
of footstools and upsettin&rsquo; things promiscuous.&nbsp; It cheers
a invalid up, that sort o&rsquo; thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie laughed in an awkward, unwonted way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it do, missis,&rdquo; pursued Joseph, &ldquo;wonderful;
and I can&rsquo;t do it myself.&nbsp; I tried the other day, and master
only thought I&rsquo;d been drinkin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are impatient,&rdquo; said Marie.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is better,
I know.&nbsp; I can see it.&nbsp; You see it yourself&mdash;yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bit&mdash;just a bit.&nbsp; But he wants some one of his
own station in life, without offence, Mistress Marie.&nbsp; Some one
as will talk with him about books and evenin&rsquo; parties and things.&nbsp;
And&mdash;&rdquo; he paused reflectively, &ldquo;and Miss Gordon would
do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little silence, during which another pancake met its
fate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; said Joseph, with sudden confidence, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
goin&rsquo; to marry a young lady at home, in London; a young lady of
fashion, as they say&mdash;one of them that&rsquo;s got one smile for
men and another for women.&nbsp; Not his sort, as I should have thought
myself, knowin&rsquo; him as I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why does he marry her?&rdquo; asked Marie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;&nbsp; Joseph rose, and stretched out his arms with
a freedom from restraint learnt in the barrack-room.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
you&rsquo;re asking me more than I can tell you.&nbsp; I suppose&mdash;it&rsquo;s
the old story&mdash;I suppose he thinks that she is his sort.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.&nbsp; A CHANCE ACQUAINTANCE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The pride that prompts the bitter
jest.</i></p>
<p>A space had with some difficulty been cleared at the upper end of
an aristocratic London drawing-room, and with considerable enthusiasm
Miss Fitzmannering pranced into the middle of it.&nbsp; Miss Fitzmannering
had kindly allowed herself to be persuaded to do &ldquo;only a few steps&rdquo;
of her celebrated skirt-dance.&nbsp; Miss Eline Fitzmannering officiated
at the piano, and later on, while they were brushing their hair, they
quarrelled because she took the time too quickly.</p>
<p>The aristocratic assembly looked on with mixed feelings, and faces
suitable to the same.&nbsp; The girls who could not skirt-dance yawned
behind their fans&mdash;gauze preferred, because the Fitzmannerings
could see through gauze if they could not see through anything else.&nbsp;
The gifted products of fashionable Brighton schools, who could in their
own way make exhibitions of themselves also, wondered who on earth had
taught Miss Fitzmannering; and the servants at the door felt ashamed
of themselves without knowing why.</p>
<p>Miss Fitzmannering had practised that skirt-dance&mdash;those few
steps&mdash;religiously for the last month.&nbsp; She had been taught
those same contortions by a young lady in <i>the</i> profession, whom
even Billy Fitzmannering raised his eyebrows at.&nbsp; And every one
knows that Billy is not particular.&nbsp; The performance was not graceful,
and the gentlemen present, who knew more about dancing&mdash;skirt or
otherwise&mdash;than they cared to admit, pursed up the corners of their
mouths and looked straight in front of them&mdash;afraid to meet the
eye of some person or persons undefined.</p>
<p>But the best face there was that of Sir John Meredith.&nbsp; He was
not bored, as were many of his juniors&mdash;at least, he did not look
it.&nbsp; He was neither shocked nor disgusted, as apparently were some
of his contemporaries&mdash;at least, his face betrayed neither of those
emotions.&nbsp; He was keenly interested&mdash;suavely attentive.&nbsp;
He followed each spasmodic movement with imperturbably pleasant eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear young lady,&rdquo; he said, with one of his courtliest
bows, when at last Miss Fitzmannering had had enough of it, &ldquo;you
have given us a great treat&mdash;you have, indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A most unique performance,&rdquo; he continued, turning gravely
to Lady Cantourne, by whose side he had been standing; and, strange
to say, her ladyship made a reproving little movement of the lips, and
tapped his elbow surreptitiously, as if he were misbehaving himself.</p>
<p>He offered his arm with a murmur of refreshments, and she accepted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, when they were alone, or nearly so,
&ldquo;do you not admit that it was a most unique performance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; replied the lady, either because she was a woman
or because she was a woman of the world.&nbsp; &ldquo;The poor girl
cannot help it.&nbsp; She is forced into it by the exigencies of society,
and her mother.&nbsp; It is not entirely her fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be entirely my fault,&rdquo; replied Sir John, &ldquo;if
I see her do it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does not matter about a man,&rdquo; said Lady Cantourne,
after a little pause; &ldquo;but a woman cannot afford to make a fool
of herself.&nbsp; She ought never to run the risk of being laughed at.&nbsp;
And yet I am told that they teach that elegant accomplishment at fashionable
schools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which proves that the schoolmistress is a knave as well as&mdash;the
other thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They passed down the long room together&mdash;a pattern, to the younger
generation, of politeness and mutual respect.&nbsp; And that which one
or other did not see was not worth comprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who,&rdquo; asked Sir John, when they had passed into the
other room, &ldquo;who is the tall fair girl who was sitting near the
fireplace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not seem to think it necessary to ask Lady Cantourne whether
she had noticed the object of his curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just wondering,&rdquo; replied Lady Cantourne, stirring
her tea comfortably.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will find out.&nbsp; She interests
me.&nbsp; She is different from the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she does not let it be seen&mdash;that is what I like,&rdquo;
said Sir John.&nbsp; &ldquo;The great secret of success in the world
is to be different from other people and conceal the fact.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He stood his full height, and looked round with blinking, cynical eyes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They are all very like each other, and they fail to conceal that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dislike a person,&rdquo; said Lady Cantourne in her tolerant
way, &ldquo;who looks out of place anywhere.&nbsp; That girl would never
look so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John was still looking round, seeing all that there was to be
seen, and much that was not intended for that purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of them,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will look self-conscious
in heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said Lady Cantourne quietly; &ldquo;that
is the least one may expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust that there will be no skirt&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir
John broke off suddenly, with a quick smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was about
to be profane,&rdquo; he said, taking her cup.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I know
you do not like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up at him with a wan little smile.&nbsp; She was wondering
whether he remembered as well as she did that half an ordinary lifetime
lay between that moment and the occasion when she reproved his profanity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said, rising, &ldquo;take me back to the
drawing-room, and I will make somebody introduce me to the girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jocelyn Gordon, sitting near the fire, talking to a white-moustached
explorer, and listening good-naturedly to a graphic account of travels
which had been put in the background by more recent wanderers, was somewhat
astounded when the hostess came up to her a few minutes later, and introduced
a stout little lady, with twinkling, kindly eyes, by the name of Lady
Cantourne.&nbsp; She had heard vaguely of Lady Cantourne as a society
leader of the old school, but had no clue to this obviously intentional
introduction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are wondering,&rdquo; said Lady Cantourne, when she had
sent the explorer on his travels elsewhere in order that she might have
his seat&mdash;&ldquo;you are wondering why I asked to know you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked into the girl&rsquo;s face with bright, searching eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I was,&rdquo; admitted Jocelyn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have two reasons: one vulgar&mdash;the other sentimental.&nbsp;
The vulgar reason was curiosity.&nbsp; I like to know people whose appearance
prepossesses me.&nbsp; I am an old woman&mdash;no, you need not shake
your head, my dear! not with me&mdash;I am almost a very old woman,
but not quite; and all my life I have trusted in appearances.&nbsp;
And,&rdquo; she paused, studying the lace of her fan, &ldquo;I suppose
I have not made more mistakes than other people.&nbsp; I have always
made a point of trying to get to know people whose appearance I like.&nbsp;
That is my vulgar reason.&nbsp; You do not mind my saying so&mdash;do
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jocelyn laughed with slightly heightened colour, which Lady Cantourne
noted with an appreciative little nod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My other reason is that, years ago at school, I knew a girl
who was very like you.&nbsp; I loved her intensely&mdash;for a short
time&mdash;as girls do at school, you know.&nbsp; Her name was Treseaton&mdash;the
Honourable Julia Treseaton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother!&rdquo; said Jocelyn eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so.&nbsp; I did not think so at first, but when
you spoke I was certain of it.&nbsp; She had a way with her lips.&nbsp;
I am afraid she is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; she died nearly twenty-five years ago in Africa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Africa&mdash;whereabouts in Africa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then suddenly Jocelyn remembered where she had heard Lady Cantourne&rsquo;s
name.&nbsp; It had only been mentioned to her once.&nbsp; And this was
the aunt with whom Millicent Chyne lived.&nbsp; This cheery little lady
knew Jack Meredith and Guy Oscard; and Millicent Chyne&rsquo;s daily
life was part of her existence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The West Coast,&rdquo; she answered vaguely.&nbsp; She wanted
time to think&mdash;to arrange things in her mind.&nbsp; She was afraid
of the mention of Jack&rsquo;s name in the presence of this woman of
the world.&nbsp; She did not mind Maurice or Guy Oscard&mdash;but it
was different with a woman.&nbsp; She could hardly have said a better
thing, because it took Lady Cantourne some seconds to work out in her
mind where the West Coast of Africa was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the unhealthy coast, is it not?&rdquo; asked her ladyship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jocelyn hardly heard the question.&nbsp; She was looking round with
a sudden, breathless eagerness.&nbsp; It was probable that Millicent
Chyne was in the rooms; and she never doubted that she would know her
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I suppose you know that part of the world very well?&rdquo;
said Lady Cantourne, who had detected a change in her companion&rsquo;s
manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever heard of a place called Loango?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes.&nbsp; I live there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, how very interesting!&nbsp; I am very much interested
in Loango just now, I must tell you.&nbsp; But I did not know that anybody
lived there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one does by choice,&rdquo; explained Jocelyn.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
father was a judge on the Coast, and since his death my brother Maurice
has held an appointment at Loango.&nbsp; We are obliged to live there
for eight months in the twelve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She knew it was coming.&nbsp; But, as chance would have it, it was
easier than she could have hoped.&nbsp; For some reason Lady Cantourne
looked straight in front of her when she asked the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you have, no doubt, met a friend of mine&mdash;Mr. Meredith?&nbsp;
Indeed, two friends; for I understand that Guy Oscard is associated
with him in this wonderful discovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; replied Jocelyn, with a carefully modulated
interest, &ldquo;I have met them both.&nbsp; Mr. Oscard lunched with
us shortly before we left Africa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that was when he disappeared so suddenly.&nbsp; We never
got quite to the base of that affair.&nbsp; He left at a moment&rsquo;s
notice on receipt of a telegram or something, only leaving a short and
somewhat vague note for my&mdash;for us.&nbsp; He wrote from Africa,
I believe, but I never heard the details.&nbsp; I imagine Jack Meredith
was in some difficulty.&nbsp; But it is a wonderful scheme this, is
it not?&nbsp; They are certain to make a fortune, I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So people say,&rdquo; replied Jocelyn.&nbsp; It was a choice
to tell all&mdash;to tell as much as she herself knew&mdash;or nothing.&nbsp;
So she told nothing.&nbsp; She could not say that she had been forced
by a sudden breakdown of her brother&rsquo;s health to leave Loango
while Jack Meredith&rsquo;s fate was still wrapped in doubt.&nbsp; She
could not tell Lady Cantourne that all her world was in Africa&mdash;that
she was counting the days until she could go back thither.&nbsp; She
could not lift for a second the veil that hid the aching, restless anxiety
in her heart, the life-absorbing desire to know whether Guy Oscard had
reached the Plateau in time.&nbsp; Her heart was so sore that she could
not even speak of Jack Meredith&rsquo;s danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange,&rdquo; said Lady Cantourne, &ldquo;to think that
you are actually living in Loango, and that you are the last person
who has spoken to Jack Meredith!&nbsp; There are two people in this
house to-night who would like to ask you questions from now till morning,
but neither of them will do it.&nbsp; Did you see me go through the
room just now with a tall gentleman&mdash;rather old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Jocelyn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was Sir John Meredith, Jack&rsquo;s father,&rdquo; said
Lady Cantourne in a lowered voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;They have quarrelled,
you know.&nbsp; People say that Sir John does not care&mdash;that he
is heartless, and all that sort of thing.&nbsp; The world never says
the other sort of thing, one finds.&nbsp; But&mdash;but I think I know
to the contrary.&nbsp; He feels it very deeply.&nbsp; He would give
worlds to hear some news of Jack; but he won&rsquo;t ask it, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jocelyn, &ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She saw what was coming, and she desired it intensely, while still
feeling afraid&mdash;as if they were walking on some sacred ground and
might at any moment make a false step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like Sir John to meet you,&rdquo; said Lady Cantourne
pleasantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will you come to tea some afternoon?&nbsp;
Strange to say, he asked who you were not half an hour ago.&nbsp; It
almost seems like instinct, does it not?&nbsp; I do not believe in mystic
things about spirits and souls going out to each other, and all that
nonsense; but I believe in instinct.&nbsp; Will you come to-morrow?&nbsp;
You are here to-night with Mrs. Sander, are you not?&nbsp; I know her.&nbsp;
She will let you come alone.&nbsp; Five o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; You will
see my niece Millicent.&nbsp; She is engaged to be married to Jack Meredith,
you know.&nbsp; That is why they quarrelled&mdash;the father and son.&nbsp;
You will find a little difficulty with her too.&nbsp; She is a difficult
girl.&nbsp; But I dare say you will manage to tell her what she wants
to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jocelyn quietly&mdash;almost too quietly,
&ldquo;I shall manage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Cantourne rose, and so did Jocelyn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she said, looking up into the girl&rsquo;s
face, &ldquo;it is a good action.&nbsp; That is why I ask you to do
it.&nbsp; It is not often that one has the opportunity of doing a good
action to which even one&rsquo;s dearest friend cannot attribute an
ulterior motive.&nbsp; Who is that man over there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to know him; but do not bring him to-morrow.&nbsp;
We women are better alone&mdash;you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a confidential little nod the good lady went away to attend
to other affairs; possibly to carry through some more good actions of
a safe nature.</p>
<p>It was plain to Jocelyn that Maurice was looking for some one.&nbsp;
He had just come, and was making his way through the crowd.&nbsp; Presently
she managed to touch his elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there you are!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;I want you.&nbsp;
Come out of this room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He offered her his arm, and together they made their way out of the
crowded room into a smaller apartment where an amateur reciter was hovering
disconsolately awaiting an audience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Maurice, when they were alone, &ldquo;I
have just had this telegram.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He handed her the thin, white submarine telegraph-form with its streaks
of adhesive text.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Relief entirely successful.&nbsp; Meredith Joseph returned
Loango.&nbsp; Meredith bad health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jocelyn drew a deep breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s all right&mdash;eh?&rdquo; said Maurice heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Jocelyn, &ldquo;that is all right.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.&nbsp; OLD BIRDS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Angels call it heavenly joy;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infernal
tortures the devils say;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And men?&nbsp;
They call it&mdash;Love.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, dear,&rdquo; said Lady Cantourne to her niece
the next afternoon, &ldquo;I have asked a Miss Gordon to come to tea
this afternoon.&nbsp; I met her last night at the Fitzmannerings.&nbsp;
She lives in Loango and knows Jack.&nbsp; I thought you might like to
know her.&nbsp; She is exceptionally ladylike and rather pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And straightway Miss Millicent Chyne went upstairs to put on her
best dress.</p>
<p>We men cannot expect to understand these small matters&mdash;these
exigencies, as it were, of female life.&nbsp; But we may be permitted
to note feebly <i>en passant</i> through existence that there are occasions
when women put on their best clothes without the desire to please.&nbsp;
And, while Millicent Chyne was actually attiring herself, Jocelyn Gordon,
in another house not so far away, was busy with that beautiful hair
of hers, patting here, drawing out there, pinning, poking, pressing
with all the cunning that her fingers possessed.</p>
<p>When they met a little later in Lady Cantourne&rsquo;s uncompromisingly
solid and old-fashioned drawing-room, one may be certain that nothing
was lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My aunt tells me,&rdquo; began Millicent at once, with that
<i>d&eacute;gage</i> treatment of certain topics hitherto held sacred
which obtains among young folks to-day, &ldquo;that you know Loango.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes&mdash;I live there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you know Mr. Meredith?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and Mr. Oscard also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little pause, while two politely smiling pairs of eyes
probed each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She knows something&mdash;how much?&rdquo; was behind one
pair of eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She cannot find out&mdash;I am not afraid of her,&rdquo; behind
the other.</p>
<p>And Lady Cantourne, the proverbial looker-on, slowly rubbed her white
hands one over the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; said Millicent unblushingly&mdash;that was
her strong point, blushing in the right place, but not in the wrong&mdash;&ldquo;Mr.
Oscard is associated with Mr. Meredith, is he not, in this hare-brained
scheme?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe they are together in it&mdash;the Simiacine, you
mean?&rdquo; said Jocelyn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else could she mean?&rdquo; reflected the looker-on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;the Simiacine.&nbsp; Such a singular name, is it
not?&nbsp; I always say they will ruin themselves suddenly.&nbsp; People
always do, don&rsquo;t they?&nbsp; But what do you think of it?&nbsp;
I <i>should</i> like to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think they certainly will make a fortune,&rdquo; replied
Jocelyn&mdash;and she noted the light in Millicent&rsquo;s eyes with
a sudden feeling of dislike&mdash;&ldquo;unless the risks prove too
great and they are forced to abandon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What risks?&rdquo; asked Millicent, quite forgetting to modulate
her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course, the Ogowe river is most horribly unhealthy,
and there are other risks.&nbsp; The natives in the plains surrounding
the Simiacine Plateau are antagonistic.&nbsp; Indeed, the Plateau was
surrounded and quite besieged when we left Africa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may have hurt Millicent, but it hurt Jocelyn more&mdash;for the
smile had left her hearer&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; She was off her guard,
as she had been once before when Sir John was near, and Millicent&rsquo;s
face betrayed something which Jocelyn saw at once with a sick heart&mdash;something
that Sir John knew from the morning when he had seen Millicent open
two letters&mdash;something that Lady Cantourne had known all along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was Mr. Meredith on the Plateau when it was besieged?&rdquo;
asked Millicent, with a drawn, crooked smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Jocelyn.&nbsp; She could not help seizing
the poor little satisfaction of this punishment; but she felt all the
while that it was nothing to the punishment she was bearing, and would
bear all her life.&nbsp; There are few more contradictory things than
the heart of a woman who really loves.&nbsp; For one man it is very
tender; for the rest of the world it is the hardest heart on earth if
it is called upon to defend the object of its love or the love itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; cried Millicent, &ldquo;of course something was
done.&nbsp; They could never leave Mr. Meredith unprotected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Jocelyn quietly, &ldquo;Mr. Oscard went
up and rescued him.&nbsp; My brother heard yesterday that the relief
had been effected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Millicent smiled again in her light-hearted way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all right,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a good
thing we did not know!&nbsp; Just think, auntie dear, what a lot of
anxiety we have been spared!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the height of the season, too!&rdquo; said Jocelyn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&mdash;es,&rdquo; replied Millicent, rather doubtfully.</p>
<p>Lady Cantourne was puzzled.&nbsp; There was something going on which
she did not understand.&nbsp; Within the sound of the pleasant conversation
there was the <i>cliquetis</i> of the foil; behind the polite smile
there was the gleam of steel.&nbsp; She was rather relieved to turn
at this moment and see Sir John Meredith entering the room with his
usual courtly bow.&nbsp; He always entered her drawing-room like that.&nbsp;
Ah! that little secret of a mutual respect.&nbsp; Some people who are
young now will wish, before they have grown old, that they had known
it.</p>
<p>He shook hands with Lady Cantourne and with Millicent.&nbsp; Then
he stood with a deferential half-bow, waiting for the introduction to
the girl who was young enough to be his daughter&mdash;almost to be
his granddaughter.&nbsp; There was something pathetic and yet proud
in this old man&rsquo;s uncompromising adherence to the lessons of his
youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir John Meredith&mdash;Miss Gordon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beginning&mdash;the thin end of the wedge, as the homely saying
has it&mdash;the end which we introduce almost every day of our lives,
little suspecting to what it may broaden out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had the pleasure of seeing you last night,&rdquo; said Sir
John at once, &ldquo;at Lady Fitzmannering&rsquo;s evening party, or
&lsquo;At Home,&rsquo; I believe we call them nowadays.&nbsp; Some of
the guests read the invitation too much <i>au pied de la lettre</i>
for my taste.&nbsp; They were so much at home that I, fearing to intrude,
left rather early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe the skirt-dancing frightened you away, Sir John,&rdquo;
said Millicent merrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even old birds, my dear young lady, may sometimes be alarmed
by a scarecrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I missed you quite early in the evening,&rdquo; put in Lady
Cantourne, sternly refusing to laugh.&nbsp; She had not had an opportunity
of seeing him since her conversation with Jocelyn, and the dangers of
the situation were fully appreciated by such an experienced woman of
the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They began to clear the upper end of the room,&rdquo; he explained,
&ldquo;and I assisted them in the most practical manner in my power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was beginning to wonder why he had been invited&mdash;nay, almost
commanded&mdash;to come, by an imperious little note.&nbsp; And of late,
whenever Sir John began to wonder he began also to feel old.&nbsp; His
fingers strayed towards his unsteady lips as if he were about to make
one of those little movements of senile helplessness to which he sometimes
gave way.</p>
<p>For a moment Lady Cantourne hesitated between two strokes of social
diplomacy&mdash;but only for a moment.&nbsp; She had heard the bell
ring, and trusted that at the other end of the wire there might be one
of those fatuous young men who nibbled at that wire like foolish fish
round a gilt spoon-bait.&nbsp; Her ladyship decided to carry on the
social farce a few minutes longer, instead of offering the explanation
which all were awaiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We women,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;were not so easily deterred
from our social duties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment the door opened, and there entered a complex odour
of hairwash and perfumery&mdash;a collar which must have been nearly
related to a cuff, and a pair of tight patent-leather boots, all attached
to and somewhat overpowering a young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my dear Mr. Grubb,&rdquo; said Lady Cantourne, &ldquo;how
good of you to call so soon!&nbsp; You will have some tea.&nbsp; Millicent,
give Mr. Grubb some tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not too strong,&rdquo; added Sir John, apparently to himself,
under the cover of Mr. Grubb&rsquo;s somewhat scrappy greeting.</p>
<p>Then Lady Cantourne went to the conservatory and left Sir John and
Jocelyn at the end of the long room together.&nbsp; There is nothing
like a woman&rsquo;s instinct.&nbsp; Jocelyn spoke at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Cantourne,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;kindly asked me to
meet you to-day on purpose.&nbsp; I live at Loango; I know your son,
Mr. Meredith, and we thought you might like to hear about him and about
Loango.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She knew that with a man like Sir John any indirect approach to the
subject would be courting failure.&nbsp; His veiled old eyes suddenly
lighted up, and he turned to glance over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, with a strange hesitation, &ldquo;yes&mdash;you
are kind.&nbsp; Of course I am interested.&nbsp; I wonder,&rdquo; he
went on, with a sudden change of manner, &ldquo;I wonder how much you
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His unsteady hand was resting on her gloved fingers, and he blinked
at it as if wondering how it got there.</p>
<p>Jocelyn did not seem to notice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;that you have had a difference
of opinion&mdash;but no one else knows.&nbsp; You must not think that
Mr. Meredith has spoken of his private affairs to any one else.&nbsp;
The circumstances were exceptional, and Mr. Meredith thought that it
was due to me to give me an explanation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John looked a little puzzled, and Jocelyn went on rather hastily
to explain</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother and Mr. Meredith were at Eton together.&nbsp; They
met somewhere up the Coast, and my brother asked Mr. Meredith to come
and stay.&nbsp; It happened that Maurice was away when Mr. Meredith
arrived, and I did not know who he was, so he explained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Sir John.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you and your
brother have been kind to my boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somehow he seemed to have forgotten to be cynical.&nbsp; He had never
known what it is to have a daughter, and she was ignorant of the pleasant
everyday amenities of a father&rsquo;s love.&nbsp; As there is undoubtedly
such a thing as love at first sight, so must there be sympathy at first
sight.&nbsp; For Jocelyn it was comprehensible&mdash;nay, it was most
natural.&nbsp; This was Jack&rsquo;s father.&nbsp; In his manner, in
everything about him, there were suggestions of Jack.&nbsp; This seemed
to be a creature hewn, as it were, from the same material, moulded on
the same lines, with slightly divergent tools.&nbsp; And for him&mdash;who
can tell?&nbsp; The love that was in her heart may have reached out
to meet almost as great a love locked up in his proud soul.&nbsp; It
may have shown itself to him, openly, fearlessly, recklessly, as love
sometimes does when it is strong and pure.</p>
<p>He had carefully selected a seat within the shadow of the curtains;
but Jocelyn saw quite suddenly that he was an older man than she had
taken him to be the evening before.&nbsp; She saw through the deception
of the piteous wig&mdash;the whole art that strove to conceal the sure
decay of the body, despite the desperate effort of a mind still fresh
and vigorous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I dare say,&rdquo; he said, with a somewhat lame attempt
at cynicism, &ldquo;that you have heard no good of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jocelyn would have none of that.&nbsp; She was no child to be
abashed by sarcasm, but a woman, completed and perfected by her love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; she said sharply; &ldquo;but that is not
the truth, and you know it.&nbsp; You know as well as I do that your
son would never say a word against you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John looked hastily round.&nbsp; Lady Cantourne had come into
the room and was talking to the two young people: Millicent was glancing
uneasily over Mr. Grubb&rsquo;s brainless cranium towards them.&nbsp;
Sir John&rsquo;s stiff, unsteady fingers fumbled for a moment round
his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I was wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has always spoken of you with the greatest love and respect,&rdquo;
said Jocelyn; &ldquo;more than that, with admiration.&nbsp; But he very
rarely spoke of you at all, which I think means more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John blinked, and suddenly pulled himself together with a backward
jerk of the arms which was habitual with him.&nbsp; It almost seemed
as if he said to himself, as he squared his shoulders, &ldquo;Come,
no giving way to old age!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has his health been good?&rdquo; he asked, rather formally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe so, until quite lately.&nbsp; My brother heard yesterday
by telegram that he was at Loango in broken health,&rdquo; replied Jocelyn.</p>
<p>Sir John was looking at her keenly&mdash;his hard blue eyes like
steel between the lashless lids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You disquiet me,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have a sort
of feeling that you have bad news to tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;not exactly.&nbsp; But it
seems to me that no one realises what he is doing out in Africa&mdash;what
risks he is running.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he said, drawing in his chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
will not interrupt you.&nbsp; Tell me all you know from beginning to
end.&nbsp; I am naturally&mdash;somewhat interested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Jocelyn told him.&nbsp; And what she said was only a recapitulation
of facts known to such as have followed these pages to this point.&nbsp;
But the story did not sound quite the same as that related to Millicent.&nbsp;
It was fuller, and there were certain details touched upon lightly which
had before been emphasised&mdash;details of dangers run and risks incurred.&nbsp;
Also was it listened to in a different spirit, without shallow comment,
with a deeper insight.&nbsp; Suddenly he broke into the narrative.&nbsp;
He saw&mdash;keen old worldling that he was&mdash;a discrepancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there was no one in Loango connected
with the scheme who&rdquo;&mdash;he paused, touching her sleeve with
a bony finger&mdash;&ldquo;who sent the telegram home to young Oscard&mdash;the
telegram calling him out to Jack&rsquo;s relief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she explained lightly, &ldquo;I did.&nbsp; My brother
was away, so there was no one else to do it, you see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And perhaps he did.</p>
<p>Lady Cantourne helped them skilfully.&nbsp; But there came a time
when Millicent would stand it no longer, and the amiable Grubb wriggled
out of the room, crushed by a too obvious dismissal.</p>
<p>Sir John rose at once, and when Millicent reached them they were
talking of the previous evening&rsquo;s entertainment.</p>
<p>Sir John took his leave.&nbsp; He bowed over Jocelyn&rsquo;s hand,
and Millicent, watching them keenly, could see nothing&mdash;no gleam
of a mutual understanding in the politely smiling eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I may have the pleasure of
meeting you again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid it is doubtful,&rdquo; she answered, with something
that sounded singularly like exultation in her voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
are going back to Africa almost at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she, also, took her leave of Lady Cantourne.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.&nbsp; SEED-TIME</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>What Fate does, let Fate answer
for.</i></p>
<p>One afternoon Joseph had his wish.&nbsp; Moreover he had it given
to him even as he desired, which does not usually happen.&nbsp; We are
given a part, or the whole, so distorted that we fail to recognise it.</p>
<p>Joseph looked up from his work and saw Jocelyn coming into the bungalow
garden.</p>
<p>He went out to meet her, putting on his coat as he went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is Mr. Meredith?&rdquo; she asked at once.&nbsp; Her eyes
were very bright, and there was a sort of breathlessness in her manner
which Joseph did not understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a bit better, miss, thank you kindly.&nbsp; But he don&rsquo;t
make the progress I should like.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the weakness that
follows the malarial attack that the doctor has to fight against.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; asked Jocelyn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, miss, at the moment he is in the drawing-room.&nbsp;
We bring him down there for the change of air in the afternoon.&nbsp;
Likely as not, he&rsquo;s asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And presently Jack Meredith, lying comfortably somnolent on the outskirts
of life, heard light footsteps, but hardly heeded them.&nbsp; He knew
that some one came into the room and stood silently by his couch for
some seconds.&nbsp; He lazily unclosed his eyelids for a moment, not
in order to see who was there, but with a view of intimating that he
was not asleep.&nbsp; But he was not wholly conscious.&nbsp; To men
accustomed to an active, energetic life, a long illness is nothing but
a period of complete rest.&nbsp; In his more active moments Jack Meredith
sometimes thought that this rest of his was extending into a dangerously
long period, but he was too weak to feel anxiety about anything.</p>
<p>Jocelyn moved away and busied herself noiselessly with one or two
of those small duties of the sick-room which women see and men ignore.&nbsp;
But she could not keep away.&nbsp; She came back and stood over him
with a silent sense of possession which made that moment one of the
happiest of her life.&nbsp; She remembered it in after years, and the
complex feelings of utter happiness and complete misery that filled
it.</p>
<p>At last a fluttering moth gave the excuse her heart longed for, and
her fingers rested for a moment, light as the moth itself, on his hair.&nbsp;
There was something in the touch which made him open his eyes&mdash;uncomprehending
at first, and then filled with a sudden life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&mdash;you at last!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took her hand in both of his.&nbsp; He was weakened by illness
and a great fatigue.&nbsp; Perhaps he was off his guard, or only half
awake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never should have got better if you had not come,&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; Then, suddenly, he seemed to recall himself, and rose
with an effort from his recumbent position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; he said, with a return of his old half-humorous
manner, &ldquo;whether to thank you first for your hospitality or to
beg your pardon for making such unscrupulous use of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was looking at him closely as he stood before her, and all her
knowledge of human ills as explored on the West Coast of Africa, all
her experience, all her powers of observation, were on the alert.&nbsp;
He did not look very ill.&nbsp; The brown of a year&rsquo;s sunburn
such as he had gone through on the summit of an equatorial mountain
where there was but little atmosphere between earth and sun, does not
bleach off in a couple of months.&nbsp; Physically regarded, he was
stronger, broader, heavier-limbed, more robust, than when she had last
seen him&mdash;but her knowledge went deeper than complexion, or the
passing effort of a strong will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; she said quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are not
strong enough to stand about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He obeyed her with a little laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how pleasant it is
to see you&mdash;fresh and English-looking.&nbsp; It is like a tonic.&nbsp;
Where is Maurice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will be here soon,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;he is attending
to the landing of the stores.&nbsp; We shall soon make you strong and
well; for we have come laden with cases of delicacies for your special
delectation.&nbsp; Your father chose them himself at Fortnum and Mason&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He winced at the mention of his father&rsquo;s name, and drew in
his legs in a peculiar, decisive way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you knew I was ill?&rdquo; he said, almost suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Joseph telegraphed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To whom?&rdquo; sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Maurice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack Meredith nodded his head.&nbsp; It was perhaps just as well
that the communicative Joseph was not there at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did not expect you for another ten days,&rdquo; said Meredith
after a little pause, as if anxious to change the subject.&nbsp; &ldquo;Marie
said that your brother&rsquo;s leave was not up until the week after
next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jocelyn turned away, apparently to close the window.&nbsp; She hesitated.&nbsp;
She could not tell him what had brought them back sooner&mdash;what
had demanded of Maurice Gordon the sacrifice of ten days of his holiday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do not always take our full term,&rdquo; she said vaguely.</p>
<p>And he never saw it.&nbsp; The vanity of man is a strange thing.&nbsp;
It makes him see intentions that were never conceived; and without vanity
to guide his perception man is as blind a creature as walks upon this
earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However,&rdquo; he said, as if to prove his own density, &ldquo;I
am selfishly very glad that you had to come back sooner.&nbsp; Not only
on account of the delicacies&mdash;I must ask you to believe that.&nbsp;
Did my eye brighten at the mention of Fortnum and Mason?&nbsp; I am
afraid it did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed softly.&nbsp; She did not pause to think that it was
to be her daily task to tend him and help to make him stronger in order
that he might go away without delay.&nbsp; She only knew that every
moment of the next few weeks was going to be full of a greater happiness
than she had ever tasted.&nbsp; As we get deeper into the slough of
life most of us learn to be thankful that the future is hidden&mdash;some
of us recognise the wisdom and the mercy which decree that even the
present be only partly revealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact,&rdquo; she said lightly, &ldquo;I suppose
that you loathe all food?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loathe it,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; He was still looking at
her, as if in enjoyment of the Englishness and freshness of which he
had spoken.&nbsp; &ldquo;Simply loathe it.&nbsp; All Joseph&rsquo;s
tact and patience are required to make me eat even eleven meals in the
day.&nbsp; He would like thirteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment Maurice came in&mdash;Maurice&mdash;hearty, eager,
full of life.&nbsp; He blustered in almost as Joseph had prophesied,
kicking the furniture, throwing his own vitality into the atmosphere.&nbsp;
Jocelyn knew that he liked Jack Meredith&mdash;and she knew more.&nbsp;
She knew, namely, that Maurice Gordon was a different man when Jack
Meredith was in Loango.&nbsp; From Meredith&rsquo;s presence he seemed
to gather a sense of security and comfort even as she did&mdash;a sense
which in herself she understood (for women analyse love), but which
in her brother puzzled her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, old chap,&rdquo; said Maurice, &ldquo;glad to see you.&nbsp;
I <i>am</i> glad to see you.&nbsp; Thank Heaven you were bowled over
by that confounded malaria, for otherwise we should have missed you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is one way of looking at it,&rdquo; answered Meredith.&nbsp;
But he did not go so far as to say that it was a way which had not previously
suggested itself to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it is.&nbsp; The best way, I take it.&nbsp; Well&mdash;how
do you feel?&nbsp; Come, you don&rsquo;t look so bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;much better, thanks.&nbsp; I have got on splendidly
the last week, and better still the last five minutes!&nbsp; The worst
of it is that I shall be getting well too soon and shall have to be
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home?&rdquo; inquired Maurice significantly.</p>
<p>Jocelyn moved uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t often hear people say that they are sorry to
leave Loango,&rdquo; said Maurice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> will oblige you whenever you are taken with the desire,&rdquo;
answered Jack lightly; &ldquo;Loango has been a very good friend to
me.&nbsp; But I am afraid there is no choice.&nbsp; The doctor speaks
very plain words about it.&nbsp; Besides, I am bound to go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To sell the Simiacine?&rdquo; inquired Maurice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you the second crop with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the trees have improved under cultivation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Jack rather wonderingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
seem to know a lot about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; replied Maurice boisterously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Durnovo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; he even offered to take me into partnership.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack turned on him in a flash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he indeed?&nbsp; On what conditions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, when it was too late, Maurice saw his mistake.&nbsp; It
was not the first time that the exuberance of his nature had got him
into a difficulty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he replied vaguely.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a long story.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you about it some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack would have left it there for the moment.&nbsp; Maurice Gordon
had made his meaning quite clear by glancing significantly towards his
sister.&nbsp; Her presence, he intimated, debarred further explanation.</p>
<p>But Jocelyn would not have it thus.&nbsp; She shrewdly suspected
the nature of the bargain proposed by Durnovo, and a sudden desire possessed
her to have it all out&mdash;to drag this skeleton forth and flaunt
it in Jack Meredith&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; The shame of it all would have
a certain sweetness behind its bitterness; because, forsooth, Jack Meredith
alone was to witness the shame.&nbsp; She did not pause to define the
feeling that rose suddenly in her heart.&nbsp; She did not know that
it was merely the pride of her love&mdash;the desire that Jack Meredith,
though he would never love her, should know once for all that such a
man as Victor Durnovo could be nothing but repugnant to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you mean,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you cannot tell
Mr. Meredith because I am here, you need not hesitate on that account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maurice laughed awkwardly, and muttered something about matters of
business.&nbsp; He was not good at this sort of thing.&nbsp; Besides,
there was the initial handicapping knowledge that Jocelyn was so much
cleverer than himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether it is a matter of business or not,&rdquo; she cried
with glittering eyes, &ldquo;I want you to tell Mr. Meredith now.&nbsp;
He has a right to know.&nbsp; Tell him upon what condition Mr. Durnovo
proposed to admit you into the Simiacine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maurice still hesitated, bewildered, at a loss&mdash;as men are when
a seemingly secure secret is suddenly discovered to the world.&nbsp;
He would still have tried to fend it off; but Jack Meredith, with his
keener perception, saw that Jocelyn was determined&mdash;that further
delay would only make the matter worse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your sister wants it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you had better
tell me.&nbsp; I am not the sort of man to act rashly&mdash;on the impulse
of the moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still Maurice tried to find some means of evasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; cried Jocelyn, with flaming cheeks, &ldquo;<i>I</i>
will tell you.&nbsp; You were to be admitted into the Simiacine scheme
by Mr. Durnovo if you could persuade or force me to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>None of them had foreseen this.&nbsp; It had come about so strangely,
and yet so easily, in the midst of their first greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted Maurice, &ldquo;that was it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what answer did you give?&rdquo; asked Jocelyn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I told him to go and hang himself&mdash;or words to that
effect,&rdquo; was the reply, delivered with a deprecating laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that your final answer?&rdquo; pursued Jocelyn, inexorable.&nbsp;
Her persistence surprised Jack.&nbsp; Perhaps it surprised herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he cut up rough and threatened to make things disagreeable;
so I think I said that it was no good his asking me to do anything in
the matter, as I didn&rsquo;t know your feelings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can tell him,&rdquo; cried Jocelyn hotly, &ldquo;that
never, under any circumstances whatever, would I dream even of the possibility
of marrying him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the two men were alone.</p>
<p>Maurice Gordon gazed blankly at the closed door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was I to know she&rsquo;d take it like that?&rdquo; he
asked helplessly.</p>
<p>And for once the polished gentleman of the world forgot himself&mdash;carried
away by a sudden unreasoning anger which surprised him almost as much
as it did Maurice Gordon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you damned fool,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;any idiot would
have known that she would take it like that.&nbsp; How could she do
otherwise?&nbsp; You, her brother, ought to know that to a girl like
Miss Gordon the idea of marrying such a low brute as Durnovo could only
be repugnant.&nbsp; Durnovo&mdash;why, he is not good enough to sweep
the floor that she has stood upon!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s not fit to speak
to her; and you go on letting him come to the house, sickening her with
his beastly attentions!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re not capable of looking after
a lady!&nbsp; I would have kicked Durnovo through that very window myself,
only&rdquo;&mdash;he paused, recalling himself with a little laugh&mdash;&ldquo;only
it was not my business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maurice Gordon sat down forlornly.&nbsp; He tapped his boot with
his cane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s very well for you,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;m not a free agent.&nbsp; <i>I</i> can&rsquo;t afford to make
an enemy of Durnovo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not have made an enemy of him,&rdquo; said Jack,
and he saved Maurice Gordon by speaking quickly&mdash;saved him from
making a confession which could hardly have failed to alter both their
lives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will not be very difficult,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;all
she wants is your passive resistance.&nbsp; She does not want you to
help <i>him</i>&mdash;do you see?&nbsp; She can do the rest.&nbsp; Girls
can manage these things better than we think, if they want to.&nbsp;
The difficulty usually arises from the fact that they are not always
quite sure that they do want to.&nbsp; Go and beg her pardon.&nbsp;
It will be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Maurice Gordon went away also, leaving Jack Meredith alone in
the drawing-room with his own thoughts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Feel like gettin&rsquo; up to breakfast, do you, sir?&rdquo;
said Joseph to his master a few days later.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I am
glad.&nbsp; Glad ain&rsquo;t quite the word, though!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he proceeded to perform the duties attendant on his master&rsquo;s
wardrobe with a wise, deep-seated shake of the head.&nbsp; While setting
the shaving necessaries in order on the dressing-table, he went further&mdash;he
winked gravely at himself in the looking-glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made wonderful progress the last few days, sir,&rdquo;
he remarked.&nbsp; &ldquo;I always told Missis Marie that it would do
you a lot of good to have Mr. Gordon to heart you up with his cheery

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but they would not have been much good without all your

felt it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joseph grinned&mdash;an honest, open grin of self-satisfaction.&nbsp;
He was not one of those persons who like their praise bestowed with
subtlety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; he repeated to himself as he went to the
well in the garden for his master&rsquo;s bath-water.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wonderful!
but I don&rsquo;t understand things&mdash;not bein&rsquo; a marryin&rsquo;
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the last few days Jack&rsquo;s progress had been rapid enough
even to satisfy Joseph.&nbsp; The doctor expressed himself fully reassured,
and even spoke of returning no more.&nbsp; But he repeated his wish
that Jack should leave for England without delay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is quite strong enough to be moved now,&rdquo; he finished
by saying.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no reason for further delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Jocelyn, to whom the order was spoken.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No&mdash;none.&nbsp; We will see that he goes by the next boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor paused.&nbsp; He was a young man who took a strong&mdash;perhaps
too strong&mdash;a personal interest in his patients.&nbsp; Jocelyn
had walked with him as far as the gate, with only a parasol to protect
her from the evening sun.&nbsp; They were old friends.&nbsp; The doctor&rsquo;s
wife was one of Jocelyn&rsquo;s closest friends on the Coast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know anything about Meredith&rsquo;s future movements?&rdquo;
he asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Does he intend to come out here again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not tell you.&nbsp; I do not think they have settled
yet.&nbsp; But I think that when he gets home he will probably stay
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best thing he can do&mdash;best thing he can do.&nbsp; It
will never do for him to risk getting another taste of malaria&mdash;tell
him so, will you?&nbsp; Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will tell him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Jocelyn Gordon walked slowly back to tell the man she loved that
he must go away from her and never come back.&nbsp; The last few days
had been days of complete happiness.&nbsp; There is no doubt that women
have the power of enjoying the present to a greater degree than men.&nbsp;
They can live in the bliss of the present moment with eyes continually
averted from the curtain of the near future which falls across that
bliss and cuts it off.&nbsp; Men allow the presence of the curtain to
mar the present brightness.</p>
<p>These days had been happier for Jocelyn than for Jack, because she
was conscious of the fulness of every moment, while he was merely rejoicing
in comfort after hardship, in pleasant society after loneliness.&nbsp;
Even with the knowledge that it could not last, that beyond the near
future lay a whole lifetime of complete solitude and that greatest of
all miseries, the desire of an obvious impossibility&mdash;even with
this she was happier than he; because she loved him and she saw him
daily getting stronger; because their relative positions brought out
the best and the least romantic part of a woman&rsquo;s love&mdash;the
subtle maternity of it.&nbsp; There is a fine romance in carrying our
lady&rsquo;s kerchief in an inner pocket, but there is something higher
and greater and much more durable in the darning of a sock; for within
the handkerchief there is chiefly gratified vanity, while within the
sock there is one of those small infantile boots which have but little
meaning for us.</p>
<p>Jocelyn entered the drawing-room with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is very pleased,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;He does
not seem to want to see you any more, and he told me to be inhospitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me to turn you out.&nbsp; You are to leave by the
next steamer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He felt a sudden unaccountable pang of disappointment at her smiling
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is no joking matter,&rdquo; he said half seriously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Am I really as well as that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst of it is that you seem rather pleased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am&mdash;at the thought that you are so much better.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She paused and turned quite away, busying herself with a pile of books
and magazines.&nbsp; &ldquo;The other,&rdquo; she went on too indifferently,
&ldquo;was unfortunately to be foreseen.&nbsp; It is the necessary drawback.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose suddenly and walked to the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The grim old necessary drawback,&rdquo; he said, without looking
towards her.</p>
<p>There was a silence of some duration.&nbsp; Neither of them seemed
to be able to find a method of breaking it without awkwardness.&nbsp;
It was she who spoke at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He also said,&rdquo; she observed in a practical way, &ldquo;that
you must not come out to Africa again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned as if he had been stung.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he make use of that particular word?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which particular word?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jocelyn had not foreseen the possibility that the doctor was merely
repeating to her what he had told Jack on a previous visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think he said &lsquo;better
not.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you make it into &lsquo;must.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed, with a sudden light-heartedness which remained unexplained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I know you both,&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;For
him &lsquo;better not&rsquo; stands for &lsquo;must.&rsquo;&nbsp; With
you &lsquo;better not&rsquo; means &lsquo;doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Better not&rsquo; is so weak that if one pits duty
against it it collapses.&nbsp; I cannot leave Oscard in the lurch, especially
after his prompt action in coming to my relief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied guardedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I like Mr.
Oscard&rsquo;s way of doing things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The matter of the telegram summoning Oscard had not yet been explained.&nbsp;
She did not want to explain it at that moment; indeed, she hoped that
the explanation would never be needed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;you will see when you get
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The least pleasant part of it is,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your
evident desire to see the last of me.&nbsp; Could you not disguise that
a little&mdash;just for the sake of my feelings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Book your passage by the next boat and I will promptly descend
to the lowest depths of despair,&rdquo; she replied lightly.</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders with a short laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is hospitality indeed,&rdquo; he said, moving towards
the door.</p>
<p>Then suddenly he turned and looked at her gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;if you are doing this
for a purpose.&nbsp; You said that you met my father&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father is not the man to ask any one&rsquo;s assistance
in his own domestic affairs, and anything I attempted to do could only
be looked upon as the most unwarrantable interference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Meredith seriously.&nbsp; &ldquo;I beg your
pardon.&nbsp; You are right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went to his own room and summoned Joseph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When is the next boat home?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boat on Thursday, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meredith nodded.&nbsp; After a little pause he pointed to a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just sit down,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want to talk
over this Simiacine business with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joseph squared his shoulders, and sat down with a face indicative
of the gravest attention.&nbsp; Sitting thus he was no longer a servant,
but a partner in the Simiacine.&nbsp; He even indulged in a sidelong
jerk of the head, as if requesting the attention of some absent friend
in a humble sphere of life to this glorious state of affairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; said Meredith, &ldquo;Mr. Durnovo is more
or less a blackguard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joseph drew in his feet, having previously hitched his trousers up
at the knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he said, glancing up.&nbsp; &ldquo;A blackguard&mdash;a
damned blackguard,&rdquo; he added unofficially under his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wants continual watching and a special treatment.&nbsp;
He requires someone constantly at his heels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; admitted Joseph, with some fervour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I am ordered home by the doctor,&rdquo; went on Meredith.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I must go by the next boat, but I don&rsquo;t like to go and
leave Mr. Oscard in the lurch, with no one to fall back upon but Durnovo&mdash;you
understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joseph&rsquo;s face had assumed the habitual look of servitude&mdash;he
was no longer a partner, but a mere retainer, with a half-comic resignation
in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; scratching the back of his neck.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am afraid I understand.&nbsp; You want me to go back to that Platter&mdash;that
God-forsaken Platter, as I may say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Meredith.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is about it.&nbsp;
I would go myself&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you!&nbsp; I know you would!&rdquo; burst in Joseph.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d go like winkin&rsquo;.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no one
knows that better nor me, sir; and what I says is&mdash;like master,
like man.&nbsp; Game, sir&mdash;game it is!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not the man to turn my back on a pal&mdash;a&mdash;a partner,
sir, so to speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Meredith, with the deep insight into
men that made command so easy to him&mdash;&ldquo;you see there is no
one else.&nbsp; There is not another man in Africa who could do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I think that Mr. Oscard will be looking for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he won&rsquo;t need to look long, sir.&nbsp; But I should
like to see you safe on board the boat.&nbsp; Then I&rsquo;m ready to
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right.&nbsp; We can both leave by Thursday&rsquo;s boat, and
we&rsquo;ll get the captain to drop you and your men at Lopez.&nbsp;
We can get things ready by then, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question thus settled, there seemed to be no necessity to prolong
the interview.&nbsp; But Joseph did not move.&nbsp; Meredith waited
patiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go up, sir, to the Platter,&rdquo; said the servant
at length, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll place myself under Mr. Oscard&rsquo;s
orders; but before I go I want to give you notice of resignation.&nbsp;
I resigns my partnership in this &rsquo;ere Simiacine at six months
from to-day.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a bit too hot, sir, that&rsquo;s the truth.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s all very well for gentlemen like yourself and Mr. Oscard,
with fortunes and fine houses, and, as sayin&rsquo; goes, a wife apiece
waiting for you at home&mdash;it&rsquo;s all very well for you to go
about in this blamed country, with yer life in yer hand, and not a tight
grip at that.&nbsp; But for a poor soldier-man like myself, what has
smelt the regulation powder all &rsquo;is life and hasn&rsquo;t got
nothing to love and no gal waiting for him at home&mdash;well, it isn&rsquo;t
good enough.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I say, sir, with respects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He added the last two words by way of apology for having banged a
very solid fist on the table.&nbsp; Meredith smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve had enough of it?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough ain&rsquo;t quite the word, sir.&nbsp; Why, I&rsquo;m
wore to a shadow with the trouble and anxiety of getting you down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fairly substantial shadow,&rdquo; commented Meredith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be, sir.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ve had enough of moneymakin&rsquo;.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s too dear at the price.&nbsp; And if you&rsquo;ll let an old
servant speak his mind it ain&rsquo;t fit for you, this &rsquo;ere kind
of work.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s good enough for black-scum and for chocolate-birds
like Durnovo; but this country&rsquo;s not built for honest white men&mdash;least
of all for born and bred gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;that&rsquo;s all very well in theory, Joseph, and
I&rsquo;m much obliged to you for thinking of me.&nbsp; But you must
remember that we live in an age where money sanctifies everything.&nbsp;
Your hands can&rsquo;t get dirty if there is money inside them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joseph laughed aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s your way of speaking, sir, that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp;
And I&rsquo;m glad to hear it.&nbsp; You have not spoken like that for
two months and more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;it is only my experience of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, talkin&rsquo; of experience, I&rsquo;ve had about
enough, as I tell you, and I beg to place my resignation in your hands.&nbsp;
I shall do the same by Mr. Oscard if I reach that Platter, God willin&rsquo;,
as the sayin&rsquo; is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Joseph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still there was something left to say.&nbsp; Joseph paused and scratched
the back of his neck pensively with one finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you be writin&rsquo; to Mr. Oscard, sir, for me to take?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I should be obliged if you would mention the fact that
I would rather not be left alone with that blackguard Durnovo, either
up at the Platter or travelling down.&nbsp; That man&rsquo;s got on
my nerves, sir; and I&rsquo;m mortal afraid of doing him a injury.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s got a long neck&mdash;you&rsquo;ve noticed that, perhaps.&nbsp;
There was a little Gourkha man up in Cabul taught me a trick&mdash;it&rsquo;s
as easy as killing a chicken&mdash;but you want a man wi&rsquo; a long
neck&mdash;just such a neck as Durnovo&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what harm has the man done you,&rdquo; asked Meredith,
&ldquo;that you think so affectionately of his neck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No harm, sir, but we&rsquo;re just like two cats on a wall,
watchin&rsquo; each other and hating each other like blue poison.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s more villainy at that man&rsquo;s back than you think
for&mdash;mark my words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joseph moved towards the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you <i>know</i> anything about him&mdash;anything shady?&rdquo;
cried Meredith after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t <i>know</i> anything.&nbsp; But
I suspects a whole box full.&nbsp; One of these days I&rsquo;ll find
him out, and if I catch him fair there&rsquo;ll be a rough and tumble.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;ll be a pretty fight, sir, for them that&rsquo;s sittin&rsquo;
in the front row.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joseph rubbed his hands slowly together and departed, leaving his
master to begin a long letter to Guy Oscard.</p>
<p>And at the other end of the passage, in her room with the door locked,
Jocelyn Gordon was sitting, hard-eyed, motionless.&nbsp; She had probably
saved the life of Jack Meredith, and in doing so had only succeeded
in sending him away from her.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.&nbsp; DARK DEALING</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Only an honest man doing his duty.</i></p>
<p>When Jack Meredith said that there was not another man in Africa
who could make his way from Loango to the Simiacine Plateau he spoke
no more than the truth.&nbsp; There were only four men in all the world
who knew the way, and two of them were isolated on the summit of a lost
mountain in the interior.&nbsp; Meredith himself was unfit for the journey.&nbsp;
There remained Joseph.</p>
<p>True, there were several natives who had made the journey, but they
were as dumb and driven animals, fighting as they were told, carrying
what they were given to carry, walking as many miles as they were considered
able to walk.&nbsp; They hired themselves out like animals, and as the
beasts of the field they did their work&mdash;patiently, without intelligence.&nbsp;
Half of them did not know where they were going&mdash;what they were
doing; the other half did not care.&nbsp; So much work, so much wage,
was their terse creed.&nbsp; They neither noted their surroundings nor
measured distance.&nbsp; At the end of their journey they settled down
to a life of ease and leisure, which was to last until necessity drove
them to work again.&nbsp; Such is the African.&nbsp; Many of them came
from distant countries, a few were Zanzibaris, and went home made men.</p>
<p>If any doubt the inability of such men to steer a course through
the wood, let him remember that three months&rsquo; growth in an African
forest will obliterate the track left by the passage of an army.&nbsp;
If any hold that men are not created so dense and unambitious as has
just been represented, let him look nearer home in our own merchant
service.&nbsp; The able-bodied seaman goes to sea all his life, but
he never gets any nearer navigating the ship&mdash;and he a white man.</p>
<p>In coming down to Loango, Joseph had had the recently-made track
of Oscard&rsquo;s rescuing party to guide him day by day.&nbsp; He knew
that this was now completely overgrown.&nbsp; The Simiacine Plateau
was once more lost to all human knowledge.</p>
<p>And up there&mdash;alone amidst the clouds&mdash;Guy Oscard was,
as he himself tersely put it, &ldquo;sticking to it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
had stuck to it to such good effect that the supply of fresh young Simiacine
was daily increasing in bulk.&nbsp; Again, Victor Durnovo seemed to
have regained his better self.&nbsp; He was like a full-blooded horse&mdash;tractable
enough if kept hard at work.&nbsp; He was a different man up on the
Plateau to what he was down at Loango.&nbsp; There are some men who
deteriorate in the wilds, while others are better, stronger, finer creatures
away from the luxury of civilisation and the softening influence of
female society.&nbsp; Of these latter was Victor Durnovo.</p>
<p>Of one thing Guy Oscard soon became aware, namely, that no one could
make the men work as could Durnovo.&nbsp; He had merely to walk to the
door of his tent to make every picker on the little Plateau bend over
his tree with renewed attention.&nbsp; And while above all was eagerness
and hurry, below, in the valley, this man&rsquo;s name insured peace.</p>
<p>The trees were now beginning to show the good result of pruning and
a regular irrigation.&nbsp; Never had the leaves been so vigorous, never
had the Simiacine trees borne such a bushy, luxuriant growth since the
dim dark days of the Flood.</p>
<p>Oscard relapsed into his old hunting ways.&nbsp; Day after day he
tranquilly shouldered his rifle, and alone, or followed by one attendant
only, he disappeared into the forest, only to emerge therefrom at sunset.&nbsp;
What he saw there he never spoke of.&nbsp; Sure it was that he must
have seen strange things, for no prying white man had set foot in these
wilds before him; no book has ever been written of that country that
lies around the Simiacine Plateau.</p>
<p>He was not the man to worry himself over uncertainties.&nbsp; He
had an enormous faith in the natural toughness of an Englishman, and
while he crawled breathlessly in the track of the forest monsters he
hardly gave a thought to Jack Meredith.&nbsp; Meredith, he argued to
himself, had always risen to the occasion: why should he not rise to
this?&nbsp; He was not the sort of man to die from want of staying power,
which, after all, is the cause of more deaths than we dream of.&nbsp;
And when he had recovered he would either return or send back Joseph
with a letter containing those suggestions of his which were really
orders.</p>
<p>Of Millicent Chyne he thought more often, with a certain tranquil
sense of a good time to come.&nbsp; In her also he placed a perfect
faith.&nbsp; A poet has found out that, if one places faith in a man,
it is probable that the man will rise to trustworthiness&mdash;of woman
he says nothing.&nbsp; But of these things Guy Oscard knew little.&nbsp;
He went his own tranquilly strong way, content to buy his own experience.</p>
<p>He was thinking of Millicent Chyne one misty morning while he walked
slowly backwards and forwards before his tent.&nbsp; His knowledge of
the country told him that the mist was nothing but the night&rsquo;s
accumulation of moisture round the summit of the mountain&mdash;that
down in the valleys it was clear, and that half an hour&rsquo;s sunshine
would disperse all.&nbsp; He was waiting for this result when he heard
a rifle-shot far away in the haze beneath him; and he knew that it was
Joseph&mdash;probably making one of those marvellous long shots of his
which roused a sudden sigh of envy in the heart of this mighty hunter
whenever he witnessed them.</p>
<p>Oscard immediately went to his tent and came out with his short-barrelled,
evil-looking rifle on his arm.&nbsp; He fired both barrels in quick
succession and waited, standing gravely on the edge of the Plateau.&nbsp;
After a short silence two answering reports rose up through the mist
to his straining ears.</p>
<p>He turned and found Victor Durnovo standing at his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked the half-breed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be Joseph,&rdquo; answered Guy, &ldquo;or Meredith.&nbsp;
It can be nobody else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us hope that it is Meredith,&rdquo; said Durnovo with
a forced laugh, &ldquo;but I doubt it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oscard looked down in his sallow, powerful face.&nbsp; He was not
quick at such things, but at that moment he felt strangely certain that
Victor Durnovo was hoping that Meredith was dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he answered, and without another
word he strode away down the little pathway from the summit into the
clouds, loading his rifle as he went.</p>
<p>Durnovo and his men, working among the Simiacine bushes, heard from
time to time a signal shot as the two Englishmen groped their way towards
each other through the everlasting night of the African forest.</p>
<p>It was midday before the new-comers were espied making their way
painfully up the slope, and Joseph&rsquo;s welcome was not so much in
Durnovo&rsquo;s handshake, in Guy Oscard&rsquo;s silent approval, as
in the row of grinning, good-natured black faces behind Durnovo&rsquo;s
back.</p>
<p>That night laughter was heard in the men&rsquo;s camp for the first
time for many weeks&mdash;nay, several months.&nbsp; According to the
account that Joseph gave to his dusky admirers, he had been on terms
of the closest familiarity with the wives, and families of all who had
such at Loango or on the Coast.&nbsp; He knew the mother of one, had
met the sweetheart of another, and confessed that it was only due to
the fact that he was not &ldquo;a marryin&rsquo; man&rdquo; that he
had not stayed at Loango for the rest of his life.&nbsp; It was somewhat
singular that he had nothing but good news to give.</p>
<p>Durnovo heard the clatter of tongues, and Guy Oscard, smoking his
contemplative pipe in a camp-chair before his hut door, noticed that
the sound did not seem very welcome.</p>
<p>Joseph&rsquo;s arrival with ten new men seemed to give a fresh zest
to the work, and the carefully-packed cases of Simiacine began to fill
Oscard&rsquo;s tent to some inconvenience.&nbsp; Thus things went on
for two tranquil weeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First,&rdquo; Oscard had said, &ldquo;let us get the crop
in and then we can arrange what is to be done about the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the crop received due attention; but the two leaders of the men&mdash;he
who led by fear and he who commanded by love&mdash;were watching each
other.</p>
<p>One evening, when the work was done, Oscard&rsquo;s meditations were
disturbed by the sound of angry voices behind the native camp.&nbsp;
He turned naturally towards Durnovo&rsquo;s tent, and saw that he was
absent.&nbsp; The voices rose and fell: there was a singular accompanying
roar of sound which Oscard never remembered having heard before.&nbsp;
It was the protesting voice of a mass of men&mdash;and there is no sound
like it&mdash;none so disquieting.&nbsp; Oscard listened attentively,
and suddenly he was thrown up on his feet by a pistol-shot.</p>
<p>At the same moment Joseph emerged from behind the tents, dragging
some one by the collar.&nbsp; The victim of Joseph&rsquo;s violence
was off his feet, but still struggling and kicking.</p>
<p>Guy Oscard saw the flash of a second shot, apparently within a few
inches of Joseph&rsquo;s face; but he came on, dragging the man with
him, whom from his clothing Oscard saw to be Durnovo.</p>
<p>Joseph was spitting out wadding and burnt powder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot <i>me</i>, would yer&mdash;yer damned skulking chocolate-bird?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll teach you!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll twist that brown neck of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook him as a terrier shakes a rat, and seemed to shake things
off him&mdash;among others a revolver which described a circle in the
air and fell heavily on the ground, where the concussion discharged
a cartridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere, sir,&rdquo; cried Joseph, literally throwing Durnovo
down on the ground at Oscard&rsquo;s feet, &ldquo;that man has just
shot one o&rsquo; them poor niggers, so &rsquo;elp me God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Durnovo rose slowly to his feet, as if the shaking had disturbed
his faculties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the man hadn&rsquo;t done &rsquo;im no harm at all.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s got a grudge against him.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen that this
last week and more.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a man as was kinder fond o&rsquo;
me, and we understood each other&rsquo;s lingo.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s it&mdash;he
was afraid of my &rsquo;earing things that mightn&rsquo;t be wholesome
for me to know.&nbsp; The man hadn&rsquo;t done no harm.&nbsp; And Durnovo
comes up and begins abusing &rsquo;im, and then he strikes &rsquo;im,
and then he out with his revolver and shoots &rsquo;im down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Durnovo gave an ugly laugh.&nbsp; He had readjusted his disordered
dress and was brushing the dirt from his knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t make a fool of yourself,&rdquo; he said in
a hissing voice; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t understand these natives at
all.&nbsp; The man raised his hand to me.&nbsp; He would have killed
me if he had had the chance.&nbsp; Shooting was the only thing left
to do.&nbsp; You can only hold these men by fear.&nbsp; They expect
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course they expect it,&rdquo; shouted Joseph in his face;
&ldquo;of course they expect it, Mr. Durnovo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they&rsquo;re <i>slaves</i>.&nbsp; Think I don&rsquo;t
know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to Oscard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man, Mr. Oscard,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is a slave-owner.&nbsp;
Them forty that joined at Msala was slaves.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s shot two
of &rsquo;em now; this is his second.&nbsp; And what does he care?&mdash;they&rsquo;re
his slaves.&nbsp; Oh! shame on yer!&rdquo; turning again to Durnovo;
&ldquo;I wonder God lets yer stand there.&nbsp; I can only think that
He doesn&rsquo;t want to dirty His hand by strikin&rsquo; yer down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oscard had taken his pipe from his lips.&nbsp; He looked bigger,
somehow, than ever.&nbsp; His brown face was turning to an ashen colour,
and there was a dull, steel-like gleam in his blue eyes.&nbsp; The terrible,
slow-kindling anger of this Northerner made Durnovo catch his breath.&nbsp;
It was so different from the sudden passion of his own countrymen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this true?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie, of course,&rdquo; answered Durnovo, with
a shrug of the shoulders.&nbsp; He moved away as if he were going to
his tent, but Oscard&rsquo;s arm reached out.&nbsp; His large brown
hand fell heavily on the half-breed&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;we are going to get to the bottom
of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; muttered Joseph, rubbing his hands slowly together;
&ldquo;this is prime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Oscard to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the wages you and Mr. Meredith has paid him
for those forty men?&rdquo; pursued Joseph.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s
the advance you made him for those men at Msala?&nbsp; Not one ha&rsquo;penny
of it have they fingered.&nbsp; And why?&nbsp; Cos they&rsquo;re slaves!
Fifteen months at fifty pounds&mdash;let them as can reckon tot it up
for theirselves.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s his first swindle&mdash;and there&rsquo;s
others, sir!&nbsp; Oh, there&rsquo;s more behind.&nbsp; That man&rsquo;s
just a stinkin&rsquo; hotbed o&rsquo; crime.&nbsp; But this &rsquo;ere
slave-owning is enough to settle his hash, I take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us have these men here&mdash;we will hear what they have
to say,&rdquo; said Oscard in the same dull tone that frightened Victor
Durnovo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not you!&rdquo; he went on, laying his hand on Durnovo&rsquo;s
shoulder again; &ldquo;Joseph will fetch them, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the forty&mdash;or the thirty-seven survivors, for one had died
on the journey up and two had been murdered&mdash;were brought.&nbsp;
They were peaceful, timorous men, whose manhood seemed to have been
crushed out of them; and slowly, word by word, their grim story was
got out of them.&nbsp; Joseph knew a little of their language, and one
of the head fighting men knew a little more, and spoke a dialect known
to Oscard.&nbsp; They were slaves they said at once, but only on Oscard&rsquo;s
promise that Durnovo should not be allowed to shoot them.&nbsp; They
had been brought from the north by a victorious chief, who in turn had
handed them over to Victor Durnovo in payment of an outstanding debt
for ammunition supplied.</p>
<p>The great African moon rose into the heavens and shone her yellow
light upon this group of men.&nbsp; Overhead all was peace: on earth
there was no peace.&nbsp; And yet it was one of Heaven&rsquo;s laws
that Victor Durnovo had broken.</p>
<p>Guy Oscard went patiently through to the end of it.&nbsp; He found
out all that there was to find; and he found out something which surprised
him.&nbsp; No one seemed to be horror-struck.&nbsp; The free men stood
stolidly looking on, as did the slaves.&nbsp; And this was Africa&mdash;the
heart of Africa, where, as Victor Durnovo said, no one knows what is
going on.&nbsp; Oscard knew that he could apply no law to Victor Durnovo
except the great law of humanity.&nbsp; There was nothing to be done,
for one individual may not execute the laws of humanity.&nbsp; All were
assembled before him&mdash;the whole of the great Simiacine Expedition
except the leader, whose influence lay over one and all only second
to his presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I leave this place at sunrise to-morrow,&rdquo; said Guy Oscard
to them all.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never want to see it again.&nbsp; I will
not touch one penny of the money that has been made.&nbsp; I speak for
Mr. Meredith and myself&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Likewise me&mdash;damn it!&rdquo; put in Joseph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I speak as Mr. Meredith himself would have spoken.&nbsp; There
is the Simiacine&mdash;you can have it.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t touch it.&nbsp;
And now who is going with me&mdash;who leaves with me to-morrow morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He moved away from Durnovo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who stays with me?&rdquo; cried the half-breed, &ldquo;to
share and share alike in the Simiacine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joseph followed Oscard, and with him a certain number of the blacks,
but some stayed.&nbsp; Some went over to Durnovo and stood beside him.&nbsp;
The slaves spoke among themselves, and then they all went over to Durnovo.</p>
<p>So that which the placid moon shone down upon was the break-up of
the great Simiacine scheme.&nbsp; Victor Durnovo had not come off so
badly.&nbsp; He had the larger half of the men by his side.&nbsp; He
had all the finest crop the trees had yielded&mdash;but he had yet to
reckon with high Heaven.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.&nbsp; AMONG THORNS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>We shut our hearts up nowadays,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like
some old music-box that plays<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfashionable
airs.</i></p>
<p>Sir John Meredith was sitting stiffly in a straight-backed chair
by his library fire.&nbsp; In his young days men did not loll in deep
chairs, with their knees higher than their heads.&nbsp; There were no
such chairs in this library, just as there was no afternoon tea except
for ladies.&nbsp; Sir John Meredith was distressed to observe a great
many signs of the degeneration of manhood, which he attributed to the
indulgence in afternoon tea.&nbsp; Sir John had lately noticed another
degeneration, namely, in the quality of the London gas.&nbsp; So serious
was this falling off that he had taken to a lamp in the evening, which
lamp stood on the table at his elbow.</p>
<p>Some months earlier&mdash;that is to say, about six months after
Jack&rsquo;s departure&mdash;Sir John had called casually upon an optician.&nbsp;
He stood upright by the counter, and frowned down on a mild-looking
man who wore the strongest spectacles made, as if in advertisement of
his own wares.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They tell me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you opticians make
glasses now which are calculated to save the sight in old age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the optician, with wriggling white
fingers.&nbsp; &ldquo;We make a special study of that.&nbsp; We endeavour
to save the sight&mdash;to store it up, as it were, in&mdash;a middle
life, for use in old age.&nbsp; You see, sir, the pupil of the eye&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John held up a warning hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pupil of the eye is your business, as I understand from
the sign above your shop&mdash;at all events, it is not mine,&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just give me some glasses to suit my sight, and
don&rsquo;t worry me with the pupil of the eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned towards the door, threw back his shoulders, and waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spectacles, sir?&rdquo; inquired the man meekly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spectacles, sir!&rdquo; cried Sir John.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, sir.&nbsp;
Spectacles be damned!&nbsp; I want a pair of eyeglasses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And these eyeglasses were affixed to the bridge of Sir John Meredith&rsquo;s
nose, as he sat stiffly in the straight-backed chair.</p>
<p>He was reading a scientific book which society had been pleased to
read, mark, and learn, without inwardly digesting, as is the way of
society with books.&nbsp; Sir John read a good deal&mdash;he had read
more lately, perhaps, since entertainments and evening parties had fallen
off so lamentably&mdash;and he made a point of keeping up with the mental
progress of the age.</p>
<p>His eyebrows were drawn down, as if the process of storing up eyesight
for his old age was somewhat laborious.&nbsp; At times he turned and
glanced over his shoulder impatiently at the lamp.</p>
<p>The room was very still in its solid old-fashioned luxury.&nbsp;
Although it was June a small wood fire burned in the grate, and the
hiss of a piece of damp bark was the only sound within the four walls.&nbsp;
From without, through the thick curtains, came at intervals the rumble
of distant wheels.&nbsp; But it was just between times, and the fashionable
world was at its dinner.&nbsp; Sir John had finished his, not because
he dined earlier than the rest of the world&mdash;he could not have
done that&mdash;but because a man dining by himself, with a butler and
a footman to wait upon him, does not take very long over his meals.</p>
<p>He was in full evening dress, of course, built up by his tailor,
bewigged, perfumed, and cunningly aided by toilet-table deceptions.</p>
<p>At times his weary old eyes wandered from the printed page to the
smouldering fire, where a whole volume seemed to be written&mdash;it
took so long to read.&nbsp; Then he would pull himself together, glance
at the lamp, readjust the eyeglasses, and plunge resolutely into the
book.&nbsp; He did not always read scientific books.&nbsp; He had a
taste for travel and adventure&mdash;the Arctic regions, Asia, Siberia,
and Africa&mdash;but Africa was all locked away in a lower drawer of
the writing-table.&nbsp; He did not care for the servants to meddle
with his books, he told himself.&nbsp; He did not tell anybody that
he did not care to let the servants see him reading his books of travel
in Africa.</p>
<p>There was nothing dismal or lonely about this old man sitting in
evening dress in a high-backed chair, stiffly reading a scientific book
of the modern, cheap science tenor&mdash;not written for scientists,
but to step in when the brain is weary of novels and afraid of communing
with itself.&nbsp; Oh, no!&nbsp; A gentleman need never be dull.&nbsp;
He has his necessary occupations.&nbsp; If he is a man of intellect
he need never be idle.&nbsp; It is an occupation to keep up with the
times.</p>
<p>Sometimes after dinner, while drinking his perfectly made black coffee,
Sir John would idly turn over the invitation cards on the mantelpiece&mdash;the
carriage was always in readiness&mdash;but of late the invitations had
not proved very tempting.&nbsp; There was no doubt that society was
not what it used to be.&nbsp; The summer was not what it used to be,
either.&nbsp; The evenings were so confoundedly cold.&nbsp; So he often
stayed at home and read a book.</p>
<p>He paused in the midst of a scientific definition and looked up with
listening eyes.&nbsp; He had got into the way of listening to the passing
wheels.&nbsp; Lady Cantourne sometimes called for him on her way to
a festivity, but it was not that.</p>
<p>The wheels he heard had stopped&mdash;perhaps it was Lady Cantourne.&nbsp;
But he did not think so.&nbsp; She drove behind a pair, and this was
not a pair.&nbsp; It was wonderful how well he could detect the difference,
considering the age of his ears.</p>
<p>A few minutes later the butler silently threw open the door, and
Jack stood in the threshold.&nbsp; Sir John Meredith&rsquo;s son had
been given back to him from the gates of death.</p>
<p>The son, like the father, was in immaculate evening dress.&nbsp;
There was a very subtle cynicism in the thought of turning aside on
such a return as this to dress&mdash;to tie a careful white tie and
brush imperceptibly ruffled hair.</p>
<p>There was a little pause, and the two tall men stood, half-bowing
with a marvellous similarity of attitude, gazing steadily into each
other&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; And one cannot help wondering whether it was
a mere accident that Jack Meredith stood motionless on the threshold
until his father said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Graves,&rdquo; he continued to the butler, with that pride
of keeping up before all the world which was his, &ldquo;bring up coffee.&nbsp;
You will take coffee?&rdquo; to his son while they shook hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The butler closed the door behind him.&nbsp; Sir John was holding
on to the back of his high chair in rather a constrained way&mdash;almost
as if he were suffering pain.&nbsp; They looked at each other again,
and there was a resemblance in the very manner of raising the eyelid.&nbsp;
There was a stronger resemblance in the grim waiting silence which neither
of them would break.</p>
<p>At last Jack spoke, approaching the fire and looking into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must excuse my taking you by surprise at this&mdash;unusual
hour.&rdquo;&nbsp; He turned; saw the lamp, the book, and the eyeglasses&mdash;more
especially the eyeglasses, which seemed to break the train of his thoughts.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I only landed at Liverpool this afternoon,&rdquo; he went on,
with hopeless politeness.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did not trouble you with a
telegram, knowing that you object to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man bowed gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am always glad to see you,&rdquo; he said suavely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Will you not sit down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they had begun wrong.&nbsp; It is probable that neither of them
had intended this.&nbsp; Both had probably dreamed of a very different
meeting.&nbsp; But both alike had counted without that stubborn pride
which will rise up at the wrong time and in the wrong place&mdash;the
pride which Jack Meredith had inherited by blood and teaching from his
father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you have dined,&rdquo; said Sir John, when they
were seated, &ldquo;or may I offer you something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, I dined on the way up&mdash;in a twilit refreshment-room,
with one waiter and a number of attendant black-beetles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Things were going worse and worse.</p>
<p>Sir John smiled, and he was still smiling when the man brought in
coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said conversationally, &ldquo;for speed combined
with discomfort I suppose we can hold up heads against any country.&nbsp;
Seeing that you are dressed, I supposed that you had dined in town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; I drove straight to my rooms, and kept the cab while
I dressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What an important matter this dressing seemed to be!&nbsp; And there
were fifteen months behind it&mdash;fifteen months which had aged one
of them and sobered the other.</p>
<p>Jack was sitting forward in his chair with his immaculate dress-shoes
on the fender&mdash;his knees apart, his elbows resting on them, his
eyes still fixed on the fire.&nbsp; Sir John looked keenly at him beneath
his frowning, lashless lids.&nbsp; He saw the few grey hairs over Jack&rsquo;s
ears, the suggested wrinkles, the drawn lines about his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been ill?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Joseph&rsquo;s letter was locked away in the top drawer of his writing-table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I had rather a bad time&mdash;a serious illness.&nbsp;
My man nursed me through it, however, with marked success; and&mdash;the
Gordons, with whom I was staying, were very kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had the pleasure of meeting Miss Gordon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s face was steady&mdash;suavely impenetrable.</p>
<p>Sir John moved a little, and set his empty cup upon the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A charming girl,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are fortunate in that man of yours,&rdquo; Sir John said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A first-class man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;he saved my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John blinked, and for the first time his fingers went to his
mouth, as if his lips had suddenly got beyond his control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I may suggest it,&rdquo; he said rather indistinctly, &ldquo;I
think it would be well if we signified our appreciation of his devotion
in some substantial way.&nbsp; We might well do something between us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused and threw back his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to give him some substantial token of my&mdash;gratitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John was nothing if not just.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; answered Jack quietly.&nbsp; He turned his
head a little, and glanced, not at his father, but in his direction.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He will appreciate it, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to see him to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack winced, as if he had made a mistake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not in England,&rdquo; he explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
left him behind me in Africa.&nbsp; He has gone back to the Simiacine
Plateau.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s face dropped rather piteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he said, with one of the sudden relapses
into old age that Lady Cantourne dreaded.&nbsp; &ldquo;I may not have
a chance of seeing him to thank him personally.&nbsp; A good servant
is so rare nowadays.&nbsp; These modern democrats seem to think that
it is a nobler thing to be a bad servant than a good one.&nbsp; As if
we were not all servants!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was thirsting for details.&nbsp; There were a thousand questions
in his heart, but not one on his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you have the kindness to remember my desire,&rdquo; he
went on suavely, &ldquo;when you are settling up with your man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; replied Jack; &ldquo;I am much obliged to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in the meantime as you are without a servant you may as
well make use of mine.&nbsp; One of my men&mdash;Henry&mdash;who is
too stupid to get into mischief&mdash;a great recommendation by the
way&mdash;understands his business.&nbsp; I will ring and have him sent
over to your rooms at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did so, and they sat in silence until the butler had come and
gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have been very successful with the Simiacine&mdash;our
scheme,&rdquo; said Jack suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have brought home a consignment valued at seventy thousand
pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John&rsquo;s face never changed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; he asked, with veiled sarcasm, &ldquo;do you carry
out the&mdash;er&mdash;commercial part of the scheme?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall begin to arrange for the sale of the consignment to-morrow.&nbsp;
I shall have no difficulty&mdash;at least, I anticipate none.&nbsp;
Yes, I do the commercial part&mdash;as well as the other.&nbsp; I held
the Plateau against two thousand natives for three months, with fifty-five
men.&nbsp; But I do the commercial part as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he was looking into the fire still, Sir John stole a long comprehensive
glance at his son&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; His old eyes lighted up with pride
and something else&mdash;possibly love.&nbsp; The clock on the mantelpiece
struck eleven.&nbsp; Jack looked at it thoughtfully, then he rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must not keep you any longer,&rdquo; he said, somewhat stiffly.</p>
<p>Sir John rose also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say you are tired; you need rest.&nbsp; In some ways
you look stronger, in others you look fagged and pulled down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the result of my illness,&rdquo; said Jack.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am really quite strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, standing on the hearthrug, then suddenly he held out his
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John allowed him to go to the door, to touch the handle, before
he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;&rdquo; he said, and Jack paused.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then
we are no farther on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In respect to the matter over which we unfortunately disagreed
before you went away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack turned, with his hand on the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not changed my mind in any respect,&rdquo; he said
gently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps you are inclined to take my altered circumstances
into consideration&mdash;to modify your views.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am getting rather old for modification,&rdquo; answered
Sir John suavely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you see no reason for altering your decision?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I am afraid we are no farther on.&rdquo;&nbsp; He paused.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; he added gently, as he opened the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.&nbsp; ENGAGED</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Well, there&rsquo;s the game.&nbsp;
I throw the stakes.</i></p>
<p>Lady Cantourne was sitting alone in her drawing-room, and the expression
of her usually bright and smiling face betokened considerable perturbation.</p>
<p>Truth to tell, there were not many things in life that had power
to frighten her ladyship very much.&nbsp; Hers had been a prosperous
life as prosperity is reckoned.&nbsp; She had married a rich man who
had retained his riches while he lived and had left them to her when
he died.&nbsp; And that was all the world knew of Lady Cantourne.&nbsp;
Like the majority of us, she presented her character and not herself
to her neighbours; and these held, as neighbours do, that the cheery,
capable little woman of the world whom they met everywhere was Lady
Cantourne.&nbsp; Circumstances alter us less than we think.&nbsp; If
we are of a gay temperament&mdash;gay we shall be through all.&nbsp;
If sombre, no happiness can drive that sombreness away.&nbsp; Lady Cantourne
was meant for happiness and a joyous motherhood.&nbsp; She had had neither;
but she went on being &ldquo;meant&rdquo; until the end&mdash;that is
to say, she was still cheery and capable.&nbsp; She had thrown an open
letter on the little table at her side&mdash;a letter from Jack Meredith
announcing his return to England, and his natural desire to call and
pay his respects in the course of the afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; she had said before she laid the letter aside,
&ldquo;he is home again&mdash;and he means to carry it through?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she had settled down to think, in her own comfortable chair
(for if one may not be happy, comfort is at all events within the reach
of some of us), and the troubled look had supervened.</p>
<p>Each of our lives is like a book with one strong character moving
through its pages.&nbsp; The strong character in Lady Cantourne&rsquo;s
book had been Sir John Meredith.&nbsp; Her whole life seemed to have
been spent on the outskirts of his&mdash;watching it.&nbsp; And what
she had seen had not been conducive to her own happiness.</p>
<p>She knew that the note she had just received meant a great deal to
Sir John Meredith.&nbsp; It meant that Jack had come home with the full
intention of fulfilling his engagement to Millicent Chyne.&nbsp; At
first she had rather resented Sir John&rsquo;s outspoken objection to
her niece as his son&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; But during the last months
she had gradually come round to his way of thinking; not, perhaps, for
the first time in her life.&nbsp; She had watched Millicent.&nbsp; She
had studied her own niece dispassionately, as much from Sir John Meredith&rsquo;s
point of view as was possible under the circumstances.&nbsp; And she
had made several discoveries.&nbsp; The first of these had been precisely
that discovery which one would expect from a woman&mdash;namely, the
state of Millicent&rsquo;s own feelings.</p>
<p>Lady Cantourne had known for the last twelve months&mdash;almost
as long as Sir John Meredith had known&mdash;that Millicent loved Jack.&nbsp;
Upon this knowledge came the humiliation&mdash;the degradation&mdash;of
one flirtation after another; and not even after, but interlaced.&nbsp;
Guy Oscard in particular, and others in a minor degree, had passed that
way.&nbsp; It was a shameless record of that which might have been good
in a man prostituted and trampled under foot by the vanity of a woman.&nbsp;
Lady Cantourne was of the world worldly; and because of that, because
the finest material has a seamy side, and the highest walks in life
have the hardiest weeds, she knew what love should be.&nbsp; Here was
a love&mdash;it may be modern, advanced, <i>chic</i>, <i>fin-de-si&egrave;cle</i>,
up-to-date, or anything the coming generation may choose to call it&mdash;but
it was eminently cheap and ephemeral because it could not make a little
sacrifice of vanity.&nbsp; For the sake of the man she loved&mdash;mark
that!&mdash;not only the man to whom she was engaged, but whom she loved&mdash;Millicent
Chyne could not forbear pandering to her own vanity by the sacrifice
of her own modesty and purity of thought.&nbsp; There was the sting
for Lady Cantourne.</p>
<p>She was tolerant and eminently wise, this old lady who had made one
huge mistake long ago; and she knew that the danger, the harm, the low
vulgarity lay in the little fact that Millicent Chyne loved Jack Meredith,
according to her lights.</p>
<p>While she still sat there the bell rang, and quite suddenly she chased
away the troubled look from her eyes, leaving there the keen, kindly
gaze to which the world of London society was well accustomed.&nbsp;
When Jack Meredith came into the room, she rose to greet him with a
smile of welcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before I shake hands,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;tell me if you
have been to see your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went last night&mdash;almost straight from the station.&nbsp;
The first person I spoke to in London, except a cabman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she shook hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she said, without looking at him&mdash;indeed,
carefully avoiding doing so&mdash;&ldquo;life is too short to quarrel
with one&rsquo;s father.&nbsp; At least it may prove too short to make
it up again&mdash;that is the danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat down, with a graceful swing of her silken skirt which was
habitual with her&mdash;the remnant of a past day.</p>
<p>Jack Meredith winced.&nbsp; He had seen a difference in his father,
and Lady Cantourne was corroborating it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The quarrel was not mine,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I admit
that I ought to have known him better.&nbsp; I ought to have spoken
to him before asking Millicent.&nbsp; It was a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Cantourne looked up suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was a mistake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not asking his&mdash;opinion first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned to the table where his letter lay, and fingered the paper
pensively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought, perhaps, that you had found that the other was
a mistake&mdash;the engagement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>Lady Cantourne&rsquo;s face betrayed nothing.&nbsp; There was no
sigh, of relief or disappointment.&nbsp; She merely looked at the clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Millicent will be in presently,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;she
is out riding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not think it necessary to add that her niece was riding with
a very youthful officer in the Guards.&nbsp; Lady Cantourne never made
mischief from a sense of duty, or any mistaken motive of that sort.&nbsp;
Some people argue that there is very little that is worth keeping secret;
to which one may reply that there is still less worth disclosing.</p>
<p>They talked of other things&mdash;of his life in Africa, of his success
with the Simiacine, of which discovery the newspapers were not yet weary&mdash;until
the bell was heard in the basement, and thereafter Millicent&rsquo;s
voice in the hall.</p>
<p>Lady Cantourne rose deliberately and went downstairs to tell her
niece that he was in the drawing-room, leaving him there, waiting, alone.</p>
<p>Presently the door opened and Millicent hurried in.&nbsp; She threw
her gloves and whip&mdash;anywhere&mdash;on the floor, and ran to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>It was very prettily done.&nbsp; In its way it was a poem.&nbsp;
But while his arms were still round her she looked towards the window,
wondering whether he had seen her ride up to the door accompanied by
the very youthful officer in the Guards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Jack&mdash;do you know,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;all
the newspapers have been full of you.&nbsp; You are quite a celebrity.&nbsp;
And are you really as rich as they say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack Meredith was conscious of a very slight check&mdash;it was not
exactly a jar.&nbsp; His feeling was that rather of a man who thinks
that he is swimming in deep water, and finds suddenly that he can touch
the bottom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can safely say that I am not,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>And it was from that eminently practical point that they departed
into the future&mdash;arranging that same, and filling up its blanks
with all the wisdom of lovers and the rest of us.</p>
<p>Lady Cantourne left them there for nearly an hour, in which space
of time she probably reflected they could build up as rosy a future
as was good for them to contemplate.&nbsp; Then she returned to the
drawing-room, followed by a full-sized footman bearing tea.</p>
<p>She was too discreet a woman&mdash;too deeply versed in the sudden
changes of the human mind and heart&mdash;to say anything until one
of them should give her a distinct lead.&nbsp; They were not shy and
awkward children.&nbsp; Perhaps she reflected that the generation to
which they belonged is not one heavily handicapped by too subtle a delicacy
of feeling.</p>
<p>Jack Meredith gave her the lead before long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Millicent,&rdquo; he said, without a vestige of embarrassment,
&ldquo;has consented to be openly engaged now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Cantourne nodded comprehensively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she is very wise,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>There was a little pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>know</i> she is very wise,&rdquo; she added, turning
and laying her hand on Jack&rsquo;s arm.&nbsp; The two phrases had quite
a different meaning.&nbsp; &ldquo;She will have a good husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you can tell <i>everybody</i> now,&rdquo; chimed in Millicent
in her silvery way.&nbsp; She was blushing and looking very pretty with
her hair blown about her ears by her last canter with the youthful officer,
who was at that moment riding pensively home with a bunch of violets
in his coat which had not been there when he started from the stable.</p>
<p>She had found out casually from Jack that Guy Oscard was exiled vaguely
to the middle of Africa for an indefinite period.&nbsp; The rest&mdash;the
youthful officer and the others&mdash;did not give her much anxiety.&nbsp;
They, she argued to herself, had nothing to bring against her.&nbsp;
They may have <i>thought</i> things&mdash;but who can prevent people
from thinking things?&nbsp; Besides, &ldquo;I thought&rdquo; is always
a poor position.</p>
<p>There were, it was true, a good many men whom she would rather not
tell herself.&nbsp; But this difficulty was obviated by requesting Lady
Cantourne to tell everybody.&nbsp; Everybody would tell everybody else,
and would, of course, ask if these particular persons in question had
been told; if not, they would have to be told at once.&nbsp; Indeed
there would be quite a competition to relieve Millicent of her little
difficulty.&nbsp; Besides, she could not marry more than one person.&nbsp;
Besides&mdash;besides&mdash;besides&mdash;the last word of Millicent
and her kind.</p>
<p>Lady Cantourne was not very communicative during that dainty little
tea <i>&agrave; trois</i>, but she listened smilingly to Jack&rsquo;s
optimistic views and Millicent&rsquo;s somewhat valueless comments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am certain,&rdquo; said Millicent, at length boldly attacking
the question that was in all their minds, &ldquo;that Sir John will
be all right now.&nbsp; Of course, it is only natural that he should
not like Jack to&mdash;to get engaged yet.&nbsp; Especially before,
when it would have made a difference to him&mdash;in money, I mean.&nbsp;
But now that Jack is independent&mdash;you know, auntie, that Jack is
richer than Sir John&mdash;is it not nice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; answered Lady Cantourne, in a voice rather suggestive
of humouring a child&rsquo;s admiration of a new toy; &ldquo;very nice
indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all so quickly!&rdquo; pursued Millicent.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only
a few months&mdash;not two years, you know.&nbsp; Of course, at first,
the time went horribly slow; but afterwards, when one got accustomed
to it, life became tolerable.&nbsp; You did not expect me to sit and
mope all day, did you, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not,&rdquo; replied Jack; and quite suddenly,
as in a flash, he saw his former self, and wondered vaguely whether
he would get back to that self.</p>
<p>Lady Cantourne was rather thoughtful at that moment.&nbsp; She could
not help coming back and back to Sir John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said to Jack, &ldquo;we must let your
father know at once.&nbsp; The news must not reach him from an outside
source.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it did,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I do not think the &lsquo;outside
source&rsquo; would get much satisfaction out of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably not; but I was not thinking of the &lsquo;outside
source&rsquo; or the outside effect.&nbsp; I was thinking of his feelings,&rdquo;
replied Lady Cantourne rather sharply.&nbsp; She had lately fallen into
the habit of not sparing Millicent very much; and that young lady, bright
and sweet and good-natured, had not failed to notice it.&nbsp; Indeed,
she had spoken of it to several people&mdash;to partners at dances and
others.&nbsp; She attributed it to approaching old age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will write and tell him,&rdquo; said Jack quietly.</p>
<p>Lady Cantourne raised her eyebrows slightly, but made no spoken comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she said, after a little pause, &ldquo;that
Millicent ought to write too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Millicent shuddered prettily.&nbsp; She was dimly conscious that
her handwriting&mdash;of an exaggerated size, executed with a special
broad-pointed pen purchasable in only one shop in Regent Street&mdash;was
not likely to meet with his approval.&nbsp; A letter written thus&mdash;two
words to a line&mdash;on note-paper that would have been vulgar had
it not been so very novel, was sure to incur prejudice before it was
fully unfolded by a stuffy, old-fashioned person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will try,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but you know, auntie dear,
I <i>cannot</i> write a long explanatory letter.&nbsp; There never seems
to be time, does there?&nbsp; Besides, I am afraid Sir John disapproves
of me.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know why; I&rsquo;m sure I have tried&rdquo;&mdash;which
was perfectly true.</p>
<p>Even funerals and lovers must bow to meal-times, and Jack Meredith
was not the man to outstay his welcome.&nbsp; He saw Lady Cantourne
glance at the clock.&nbsp; Clever as she was, she could not do it without
being seen by him.</p>
<p>So he took his leave, and Millicent went to the head of the stairs
with him.</p>
<p>He refused the pressing invitation of a hansom-cabman, and proceeded
to walk leisurely home to his rooms.&nbsp; Perhaps he was wondering
why his heart was not brimming over with joy.&nbsp; The human heart
has a singular way of seeing farther than its astute friend and coadjutor,
the brain.&nbsp; It sometimes refuses to be filled with glee, when outward
circumstances most distinctly demand that state.&nbsp; And at other
times, when outward things are strong, not to say opaque, the heart
is joyful, and we know not why.</p>
<p>Jack Meredith knew that he was the luckiest man in London.&nbsp;
He was rich, in good health, and he was engaged to be married to Millicent
Chyne, the acknowledged belle of his circle.&nbsp; She had in no way
changed.&nbsp; She was just as pretty, as fascinating, as gay as ever;
and something told him that she loved him&mdash;something which had
not been there before he went away, something that had come when the
overweening vanity of youth went.&nbsp; And it was just this knowledge
to which he clung with a nervous mental grip.&nbsp; He did not feel
elated as he should; he was aware of that, and he could not account
for it.&nbsp; But Millicent loved him, so it must be all right.&nbsp;
He had always cared for Millicent.&nbsp; Everything had been done in
order that he might marry her&mdash;the quarrel with his father, the
finding of the Simiacine, the determination to get well which had saved
his life&mdash;all this so that he might marry Millicent.&nbsp; And
now he was going to marry her, and it must be all right.&nbsp; Perhaps,
as men get older, the effervescent elation of youth leaves them; but
they are none the less happy.&nbsp; That must be it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.&nbsp; NO COMPROMISE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Where he fixed his heart he set
his hand<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do the thing he willed.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;MY DEAR SIR JOHN,&mdash;It is useless my pretending to ignore
your views respecting Jack&rsquo;s marriage to Millicent; and I therefore
take up my pen with regret to inform you that the two young people have
now decided to make public their engagement.&nbsp; Moreover, I imagine
it is their intention to get married very soon.&nbsp; You and I have
been friends through a longer spell of years than many lives and most
friendships extend, and at the risk of being considered inconsequent
I must pause to thank you&mdash;well&mdash;to thank you for having been
so true a friend to me all through my life.&nbsp; If that life were
given to me to begin again, I should like to retrace the years back
to a point when&mdash;little more than a child&mdash;I yielded to influence
and made a great mistake.&nbsp; I should like to begin my life over
again from there.&nbsp; When you first signified your disapproval of
Millicent as a wife for Jack, I confess I was a little nettled; but
on the strength of the friendship to which I have referred I must ask
you to believe that never from the moment that I learnt your opinion
have I by thought or action gone counter to it.&nbsp; This marriage
is none of my doing.&nbsp; Jack is too good for her&mdash;I see that
now.&nbsp; You are wiser than I&mdash;you always have been.&nbsp; If
any word of mine can alleviate your distress at this unwelcome event,
let it be that I am certain that Millicent has the right feeling for
your boy; and from this knowledge I cannot but gather great hopes.&nbsp;
All may yet come to your satisfaction.&nbsp; Millicent is young, and
perhaps a little volatile, but Jack inherits your strength of character;
he may mould her to better things than either you or I dream of.&nbsp;
I hope sincerely that it may be so.&nbsp; If I have appeared passive
in this matter it is not because I have been indifferent; but I know
that my yea or nay could carry no weight.&mdash;Your old friend,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;CAROLINE
CANTOURNE.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This letter reached Sir John Meredith while he was waiting for the
announcement that dinner was ready.&nbsp; The announcement arrived immediately
afterwards, but he did not go down to dinner until he had read the letter.&nbsp;
He fumbled for his newly-purchased eyeglasses, because Lady Cantourne&rsquo;s
handwriting was thin and spidery, as became a lady of standing; also
the gas was so d----d bad.&nbsp; He used this expression somewhat freely,
and usually put a &ldquo;Sir&rdquo; after it as his father had done
before him.</p>
<p>His eyes grew rather fierce as he read; then they suddenly softened,
and he threw back his shoulders as he had done a thousand times on the
threshold of Lady Cantourne&rsquo;s drawing-room.&nbsp; He read the
whole letter very carefully and gravely, as if all that the writer had
to say was worthy of his most respectful attention.&nbsp; Then he folded
the paper and placed it in the breast-pocket of his coat.&nbsp; He looked
a little bowed and strangely old, as he stood for a moment on the hearthrug
thinking.&nbsp; It was his practice to stand thus on the hearthrug from
the time that he entered the drawing-room, dressed, until the announcement
of dinner; and the cook far below in the basement was conscious of the
attitude of the master as the pointer of the clock approached the hour.</p>
<p>Of late Sir John had felt a singular desire to sit down whenever
opportunity should offer; but he had always been found standing on the
hearthrug by the butler, and, hard old aristocrat that he was, he would
not yield to the somewhat angular blandishments of the stiff-backed
chair.</p>
<p>He stood for a few moments with his back to the smouldering fire,
and, being quite alone, he perhaps forgot to stiffen his neck; for his
head drooped, his lips were unsteady.&nbsp; He was a very old man.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, when he strode into the dining-room where butler
and footman awaited him, he was erect, imperturbable, impenetrable.</p>
<p>At dinner it was evident that his keen brain was hard at work.&nbsp;
He forgot one or two of the formalities which were religiously observed
at that solitary table.&nbsp; He hastened over his wine, and then he
went to the library.&nbsp; There he wrote a telegram, slowly, in his
firm ornamental handwriting.</p>
<p>It was addressed to &ldquo;Gordon, Loango,&rdquo; and the gist of
it was&mdash;&ldquo;Wire whereabouts of Oscard&mdash;when he may be
expected home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The footman was despatched in a hansom cab, with instructions to
take the telegram to the head office of the Submarine Telegraph Company,
and there to arrange prepayment of the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather expect Mr. Meredith,&rdquo; said Sir John to the
butler, who was trimming the library lamp while the footman received
his instructions.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do not bring coffee until he comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Sir John was right.&nbsp; At half-past eight Jack arrived.&nbsp;
Sir John was awaiting him in the library, grimly sitting in his high-backed
chair, as carefully dressed as for a great reception.</p>
<p>He rose when his son entered the room, and they shook hands.&nbsp;
There was a certain air of concentration about both, as if they each
intended to say more than they had ever said before.&nbsp; The coffee
was duly brought.&nbsp; This was a revival of an old custom.&nbsp; In
bygone days Jack had frequently come in thus, and they had taken coffee
before going together in Sir John&rsquo;s carriage to one of the great
social functions at which their presence was almost a necessity.&nbsp;
Jack had always poured out the coffee&mdash;to-night he did not offer
to do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came,&rdquo; he said suddenly, &ldquo;to give you a piece
of news which I am afraid will not be very welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John bowed his head gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not temper it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Millicent and I have decided to make our engagement known,&rdquo;
retorted Jack at once.</p>
<p>Sir John bowed again.&nbsp; To any one but his son his suave acquiescence
would have been maddening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have liked,&rdquo; continued Jack, &ldquo;to have
done it with your consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John winced.&nbsp; He sat upright in his chair and threw back
his shoulders.&nbsp; If Jack intended to continue in this way, there
would be difficulties to face.&nbsp; Father and son were equally determined.&nbsp;
Jack had proved too cunning a pupil.&nbsp; The old aristocrat&rsquo;s
own lessons were being turned against him, and the younger man has,
as it were, the light of the future shining upon his game in such a
case as this, while the elder plays in the gathering gloom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; said Sir John gravely, &ldquo;that I am not
much given to altering my opinions.&nbsp; I do not say that they are
of any value; but, such as they are, I usually hold to them.&nbsp; When
you did me the honour of mentioning this matter to me last year, I gave
you my opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it has in no way altered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In no way.&nbsp; I have found no reason to alter it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you modify it?&rdquo; asked Jack gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in any degree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack drew a deep breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He emitted the breath slowly, making an effort so that it did not
take the form of a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you, at all events, give me your reasons?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am not a child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John fumbled at his lips&mdash;he glanced sharply at his son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that it would be advisable
not to ask them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to know why you object to my marrying Millicent,&rdquo;
persisted Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simply because I know a bad woman when I see her,&rdquo; retorted
Sir John deliberately.</p>
<p>Jack raised his eyebrows.&nbsp; He glanced towards the door, as if
contemplating leaving the room without further ado.&nbsp; But he sat
quite still.&nbsp; It was wonderful how little it hurt him.&nbsp; It
was more&mdash;it was significant.&nbsp; Sir John, who was watching,
saw the glance and guessed the meaning of it.&nbsp; An iron self-control
had been the first thing he had taught Jack&mdash;years before, when
he was in his first knickerbockers.&nbsp; The lesson had not been forgotten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry you have said that,&rdquo; said the son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just,&rdquo; continued the father, &ldquo;as I know a good
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, and they were both thinking of the same woman&mdash;Jocelyn
Gordon.</p>
<p>Sir John had said his say about Millicent Chyne; and his son knew
that that was the last word.&nbsp; She was a bad woman.&nbsp; From that
point he would never move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;that it is useless discussing
that point any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite.&nbsp; When do you intend getting married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mere question for the dressmaker?&rdquo; suggested Sir John
suavely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John nodded gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are, as you say, no longer
a child&mdash;perhaps I forget that sometimes.&nbsp; If I do, I must
ask you to forgive me.&nbsp; I will not attempt to dissuade you.&nbsp;
You probably know your own affairs best&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, drawing his two hands slowly back on his knees, looking
into the fire as if his life was written there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At all events,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;it has the initial
recommendation of a good motive.&nbsp; I imagine it is what is called
a love-match.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know much about such matters.&nbsp;
Your mother, my lamented wife, was an excellent woman&mdash;too excellent,
I take it, to be able to inspire the feeling in a mere human being&mdash;perhaps
the angels . . . she never inspired it in me, at all events.&nbsp; My
own life has not been quite a success within this room; outside it has
been brilliant, active, full of excitement.&nbsp; Engineers know of
machines which will stay upright so long as the pace is kept up; some
of us are like that.&nbsp; I am not complaining.&nbsp; I have had no
worse a time than my neighbours, except that it has lasted longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leant back suddenly in his chair with a strange little laugh.&nbsp;
Jack was leaning forward, listening with that respect which he always
accorded to his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine,&rdquo; went on Sir John, &ldquo;that the novelists
and poets are not very far wrong.&nbsp; It seems that there is such
a thing as a humdrum happiness in marriage.&nbsp; I have seen quite
elderly people who seem still to take pleasure in each other&rsquo;s
society.&nbsp; With the example of my own life before me, I wanted yours
to be different.&nbsp; My motive was not entirely bad.&nbsp; But perhaps
you know your own affairs best.&nbsp; What money have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack moved uneasily in his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have completed the sale of the last consignment of Simiacine,&rdquo;
he began categorically.&nbsp; &ldquo;The demand for it has increased.&nbsp;
We have now sold two hundred thousand pounds worth in England and America.&nbsp;
My share is about sixty thousand pounds.&nbsp; I have invested most
of that sum, and my present income is a little over two thousand a year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John nodded gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I congratulate you,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you have done wonderfully
well.&nbsp; It is satisfactory in one way, in that it shows that, if
a gentleman chooses to go into these commercial affairs, he can do as
well as the bourgeoisie.&nbsp; It leads one to believe that English
gentlemen are not degenerating so rapidly as I am told the evening Radical
newspapers demonstrate for the trifling consideration of one halfpenny.&nbsp;
But&rdquo;&mdash;he paused with an expressive gesture of the hand&mdash;&ldquo;I
should have preferred that this interesting truth had been proved by
the son of some one else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; replied Jack, &ldquo;that our speculation
hardly comes under the category of commerce.&nbsp; It was not money
that was at risk, but our own lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John&rsquo;s eyes hardened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adventure,&rdquo; he suggested rather indistinctly, &ldquo;travel
and adventure.&nbsp; There is a class of men one meets frequently who
do a little exploring and a great deal of talking.&nbsp; <i>Faute de
mieux</i>, they do not hesitate to interest one in the special pill
to which they resort when indisposed, and they are not above advertising
a soap.&nbsp; You are not going to write a book, I trust?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; It would hardly serve our purpose to write a book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo; inquired Sir John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our purpose is to conceal the whereabouts of the Simiacine
Plateau.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are not going back there?&rdquo; exclaimed Sir John
unguardedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly do not intend to abandon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John leant forward again with his two hands open on his knees,
thinking deeply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A married man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;could hardly reconcile
it with his conscience to undertake such a perilous expedition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Jack, with quiet significance.</p>
<p>Sir John gave a forced laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you have outwitted me.&nbsp;
If I do not give my consent to your marriage without further delay,
you will go back to Africa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack bowed his head gravely.</p>
<p>There was a long silence, while the two men sat side by side, gazing
into the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot afford to do that,&rdquo; said the father at length;
&ldquo;I am getting too old to indulge in the luxury of pride.&nbsp;
I will attend your marriage.&nbsp; I will smile and say pretty things
to the bridesmaids.&nbsp; Before the world I will consent under the
condition that the ceremony does not take place before two months from
this date.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree to that,&rdquo; put in Jack.</p>
<p>Sir John rose and stood on the hearthrug, looking down from his great
height upon his son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;between us let it be understood
that I move in no degree from my original position.&nbsp; I object to
Millicent Chyne as your wife.&nbsp; But I bow to the force of circumstances.&nbsp;
I admit that you have a perfect right to marry whom you choose&mdash;in
two months time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Jack took his leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In two months&rsquo; time,&rdquo; repeated Sir John, when
he was alone, with one of his twisted, cynic smiles, &ldquo;in two months
time&mdash;<i>qui vivra verra</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII.&nbsp; FOUL PLAY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Oh, fairest of creation, last and
best<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all God&rsquo;s works!</i></p>
<p>For one or two days after the public announcement of her engagement,
Millicent was not quite free from care.&nbsp; She rather dreaded the
posts.&nbsp; It was not that she feared one letter in particular, but
the postman&rsquo;s disquietingly urgent rap caused her a vague uneasiness
many times a day.</p>
<p>Sir John&rsquo;s reply to her appealing little letter came short
and sharp.&nbsp; She showed it to no one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;MY DEAR MISS CHYNE,&mdash;I hasten to reply to your kind letter
of to-day announcing your approaching marriage with my son.&nbsp; There
are a certain number of trinkets which have always been handed on from
generation to generation.&nbsp; I will at once have these cleaned by
the jeweller, in order that they may be presented to you immediately
after the ceremony.&nbsp; Allow me to urge upon you the advisability
of drawing up and signing a prenuptial marriage settlement.&mdash;Yours
sincerely,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;JOHN
MEREDITH.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Millicent bit her pretty lip when she perused this note.&nbsp; She
made two comments, at a considerable interval of time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stupid old thing!&rdquo; was the first; and then, after a
pause, &ldquo;I <i>hope</i> they are all diamonds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Close upon the heels of this letter followed a host of others.&nbsp;
There was the gushing, fervent letter of the friend whose joy was not
marred by the knowledge that a wedding present must necessarily follow.&nbsp;
Those among one&rsquo;s friends who are not called upon to offer a more
substantial token of joy than a letter are always the most keenly pleased
to hear the news of an engagement.&nbsp; There was the sober sheet (crossed)
from the elderly relative living in the country, who, never having been
married herself, takes the opportunity of giving four pages of advice
to one about to enter that parlous state.&nbsp; There was the fatherly
letter from the country rector who christened Millicent, and thinks
that he may be asked to marry her in a fashionable London church&mdash;and
so to a bishopric.&nbsp; On heavily-crested stationery follow the missives
of the ladies whose daughters would make sweet bridesmaids.&nbsp; Also
the hearty congratulations of the slight acquaintance, who is going
to Egypt for the winter, and being desirous of letting her house without
having to pay one of those horrid agents, &ldquo;sees no harm in mentioning
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; The house being most singularly suitable for a young
married couple.&nbsp; Besides these, the thousand and one who wished
to be invited to the wedding in order to taste cake and champagne at
the time, and thereafter the sweeter glory of seeing their names in
the fashionable news.</p>
<p>All these Millicent read with little interest, and answered in that
conveniently large calligraphy which made three lines look like a note,
and magnified a note into a four-page letter.&nbsp; The dressmakers&rsquo;
circulars&mdash;the tradesmen&rsquo;s illustrated catalogues of things
she could not possibly want, and the jewellers&rsquo; delicate photographs
interested her a thousand times more.&nbsp; But even these did not satisfy
her.&nbsp; All these people were glad&mdash;most of them were delighted.&nbsp;
Millicent wanted to hear from those who were not delighted, not even
pleased, but in despair.&nbsp; She wanted to hear more of the broken
hearts.&nbsp; But somehow the broken hearts were silent.&nbsp; Could
it be that they did not care?&nbsp; Could it be that <i>they</i> were
only flirting?&nbsp; She dismissed these silly questions with the promptness
which they deserved.&nbsp; It was useless to think of it in that way&mdash;more
useless, perhaps, than she suspected; for she was not deep enough, nor
observant enough, to know that the broken hearts in question had been
much more influenced by the suspicion that she cared for them than by
the thought that they cared for her.&nbsp; She did not know the lamentable,
vulgar fact that any woman can be a flirt if she only degrade her womanhood
to flattery.&nbsp; Men do not want to love so much as to be loved.&nbsp;
Such is, moreover, their sublime vanity that they are ready to believe
any one who tells them, however subtly&mdash;mesdames, you cannot be
too subtle for a man&rsquo;s vanity to find your meaning&mdash;that
they are not as other men.</p>
<p>To the commonplace observer it would, therefore, appear (erroneously,
no doubt) that the broken hearts having been practically assured that
Millicent Chyne did not care for them, promptly made the discovery that
the lack of feeling was reciprocal.&nbsp; But Millicent did not, of
course, adopt this theory.&nbsp; She knew better.&nbsp; She only wondered
why several young men did not communicate, and she was slightly uneasy
lest in their anger they should do or say something indiscreet.</p>
<p>There was no reason why the young people should wait.&nbsp; And when
there is no reason why the young people should wait, there is every
reason why they should not do so.&nbsp; Thus it came about that in a
week or so Millicent was engaged in the happiest pursuit of her life.&nbsp;
She was buying clothes without a thought of money.&nbsp; The full joy
of the trousseau was hers.&nbsp; The wives of her guardians having been
morally bought, dirt cheap, at the price of an anticipatory invitation
to the wedding, those elderly gentlemen were with little difficulty
won over to a pretty little femininely vague scheme of withdrawing just
a little of the capital&mdash;said capital to be spent in the purchase
of a really <i>good</i> trousseau, you know.&nbsp; The word &ldquo;good&rdquo;
emanating from such a source must, of course, be read as &ldquo;novel,&rdquo;
which in some circles means the same thing.</p>
<p>Millicent entered into the thing in the right spirit.&nbsp; Whatever
the future might hold for her&mdash;and she trusted that it might be
full of millinery&mdash;she was determined to enjoy the living present
to its utmost.&nbsp; Her life at this time was a whirl of excitement&mdash;excitement
of the keenest order&mdash;namely, trying on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not know what it is,&rdquo; she said, with a happy
little sigh, to those among her friends who probably never would, &ldquo;to
stand the whole day long being pinned into linings by Madame Videpoche.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And despite the sigh, she did it with an angelic sweetness of temper
which quite touched the heart of Madame Videpoche, while making no difference
in the bill.</p>
<p>Lady Cantourne would not have been human had she assumed the neutral
in this important matter.&nbsp; She frankly enjoyed it all immensely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Sir John,&rdquo; she said in confidence to him one
day at Hurlingham, &ldquo;I have always dressed Millicent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not tell me that,&rdquo; he interrupted gracefully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>On ne peut s&rsquo;y tromper</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; she went on almost apologetically, &ldquo;whatever
my own feelings on the subject may be, I cannot abandon her now.&nbsp;
The world expects much from Millicent Chyne.&nbsp; I have taught it
to do so.&nbsp; It will expect more from Millicent&mdash;Meredith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old gentleman bowed in his formal way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the world must not be disappointed,&rdquo; he suggested
cynically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered, with an energetic little nod, &ldquo;it
must not.&nbsp; That is the way to manage the world.&nbsp; Give it what
it expects; and just a little more to keep its attention fixed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John tapped with his gloved finger pensively on the knob of his
silver-mounted cane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And may I ask your ladyship,&rdquo; he inquired suavely, &ldquo;what
the world expects of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He knew her well enough to know that she never made use of the method
epigrammatic without good reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A diamond crescent,&rdquo; she answered stoutly.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
fashion-papers must be able to write about the gift of the bridegroom&rsquo;s
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;and they prefer a diamond crescent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Lady Cantourne.&nbsp; &ldquo;That always
seems to satisfy them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bowed gravely and continued to watch the polo with that marvellously
youthful interest which was his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does the world expect anything else?&rdquo; he asked presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I think not,&rdquo; replied Lady Cantourne, with a bright
little absent smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you tell me if it does?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had risen; for there were other great ladies on the ground to
whom he must pay his old-fashioned respects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; she answered, looking up at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should deem it a favour,&rdquo; he continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
the world does not get what it expects, I imagine it will begin to inquire
why; and if it cannot find reasons it will make them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In due course the diamond crescent arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is rather nice of the old thing,&rdquo; was Millicent&rsquo;s
comment.&nbsp; She held the jewel at various angles in various lights.&nbsp;
There was no doubt that this was the handsomest present she had received&mdash;sent
direct from the jeweller&rsquo;s shop with an uncompromising card inside
the case.&nbsp; She never saw the irony of it; but Sir John had probably
not expected that she would.&nbsp; He enjoyed it alone&mdash;as he enjoyed
or endured most things.</p>
<p>Lady Cantourne examined it with some curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never seen such beautiful diamonds,&rdquo; she said
simply.</p>
<p>There were other presents to be opened and examined.&nbsp; For the
invitations had not been sent out, and many were willing to pay handsomely
for the privilege of being mentioned among the guests.&nbsp; It is,
one finds, after the invitations have been issued that the presents
begin to fall off.</p>
<p>But on this particular morning the other presents fell on barren
ground.&nbsp; Millicent only half heeded them.&nbsp; She could not lay
the diamond crescent finally aside.&nbsp; Some people have the power
of imparting a little piece of their individuality to their letters,
and even to a commonplace gift.&nbsp; Sir John was beginning to have
this power over Millicent.&nbsp; She was rapidly falling into a stupid
habit of feeling uneasy whenever she thought of him.&nbsp; She was vaguely
alarmed at his uncompromising adherence to the position he had assumed.&nbsp;
She had never failed yet to work her will with men&mdash;young and old&mdash;by
a pretty persistence, a steady flattery, a subtle pleading manner.&nbsp;
But Sir John had met all her wiles with his adamantine smile.&nbsp;
He would not openly declare himself an enemy&mdash;which she argued
to herself would have been much nicer of him.&nbsp; He was merely a
friend of her aunt&rsquo;s, and from that contemplative position he
never stepped down.&nbsp; She could not quite make out what he was &ldquo;driving
at,&rdquo; as she herself put it.&nbsp; He never found fault, but she
knew that his disapproval of her was the result of long and careful
study.&nbsp; Perhaps in her heart&mdash;despite all her contradictory
arguments&mdash;she knew that he was right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; she said half-aloud, taking up the crescent
again, &ldquo;why he sent it to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Cantourne, who was writing letters at a terrible rate, glanced
sharply up.&nbsp; She was beginning to be aware of Millicent&rsquo;s
unspoken fear of Sir John.&nbsp; Moreover, she was clever enough to
connect it with her niece&rsquo;s daily increasing love for the man
who was soon to be her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I should be rather surprised
if he gave you nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little pause, only broken by the scratching of Lady Cantourne&rsquo;s
quill pen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Auntie!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl suddenly, &ldquo;why does
he hate me?&nbsp; You have known him all your life&mdash;you must know
why he hates me so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Cantourne shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; went on Millicent with singular heat, &ldquo;that
some one has been telling him things about me&mdash;horrid things&mdash;false
things&mdash;that I am a flirt, or something like that; I am sure I&rsquo;m
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Cantourne was addressing an envelope, and did not make any reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he said anything to you, Aunt Caroline?&rdquo; asked Millicent
in an aggrieved voice.</p>
<p>Lady Cantourne laid aside her letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered slowly, &ldquo;but I suppose there
are things which he does not understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her ladyship looked up steadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guy Oscard, for instance,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
quite understand Guy Oscard, Millicent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl turned away impatiently.&nbsp; She was keenly alive to the
advantage of turning her face away.&nbsp; For in her pocket she had
at that moment a letter from Guy Oscard&mdash;the last relic of the
old excitement which was so dear to her, and which she was already beginning
to miss.&nbsp; Joseph had posted this letter in Msala nearly two months
before.&nbsp; It had travelled down from the Simiacine Plateau with
others, in a parcel beneath the mattress of Jack Meredith&rsquo;s litter.&nbsp;
It was a letter written in good faith by an honest, devoted man to the
woman whom he looked upon already as almost his wife&mdash;a letter
which no man need have been ashamed of writing, but which a woman ought
not to have read unless she intended to be the writer&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>Millicent had read this letter more than once.&nbsp; She liked it
because it was evidently sincere.&nbsp; The man&rsquo;s heart could
be heard beating in every line of it.&nbsp; Moreover, she had made inquiries
that very morning at the Post Office about the African mail.&nbsp; She
wanted the excitement of another letter like that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Guy Oscard!&rdquo; she replied innocently to Lady Cantourne;
&ldquo;that was nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Cantourne kept silence, and presently she returned to her letters.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII.&nbsp; THE ACCURSED CAMP</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Here&mdash;judge if hell, with all
its power to damn,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can add one curse
to the foul thing I am&mdash;</i></p>
<p>There are some places in the world where a curse seems to brood in
the atmosphere.&nbsp; Msala was one of these.&nbsp; Perhaps these places
are accursed by the deeds that have been done there.&nbsp; Who can tell?</p>
<p>Could the trees&mdash;the two gigantic palms that stood by the river&rsquo;s
edge&mdash;could these have spoken, they might perhaps have told the
tale of this little inland station in that country where, as the founder
of the hamlet was in the habit of saying, no one knows what is going
on.</p>
<p>All went well with the retreating column until they were almost in
sight of Msala, when the flotilla was attacked by no less than three
hippopotamuses.&nbsp; One canoe was sunk, and four others were so badly
damaged that they could not be kept afloat with their proper complement
of men.&nbsp; There was nothing for it but to establish a camp at Msala,
and wait there until the builders had repaired the damaged canoes.</p>
<p>The walls of Durnovo&rsquo;s house were still standing, and here
Guy Oscard established himself with as much comfort as circumstances
allowed.&nbsp; He caused a temporary roof of palm-leaves to be laid
on the charred beams, and within the principal room&mdash;the very room
where the three organisers of the great Simiacine scheme had first laid
their plans&mdash;he set up his simple camp furniture.</p>
<p>Oscard was too great a traveller, too experienced a wanderer, to
be put out of temper by this enforced rest.&nbsp; The men had worked
very well hitherto.&nbsp; It had, in its way, been a great feat of generalship,
this leading through a wild country of men unprepared for travel, scantily
provisioned, disorganised by recent events.&nbsp; No accident had happened,
no serious delay had been incurred, although the rate of progress had
necessarily been very slow.&nbsp; Nearly six weeks had elapsed since
Oscard with his little following had turned their backs for ever on
the Simiacine Plateau.&nbsp; But now the period of acute danger had
passed away.&nbsp; They had almost reached civilisation.&nbsp; Oscard
was content.</p>
<p>When Oscard was content he smoked a slower pipe than usual&mdash;watching
each cloud of smoke vanish into thin air.&nbsp; He was smoking very
slowly this, the third evening of their encampment at Msala.&nbsp; There
had been heavy rain during the day, and the whole lifeless forest was
dripping with a continuous, ceaseless clatter of heavy drops on tropic
foliage; with a united sound like a widespread whisper.</p>
<p>Oscard was sitting in the windowless room without a light, for a
light only attracted a myriad of heavy-winged moths.&nbsp; He was seated
before the long French window, which, since the sash had gone, had been
used as a door.&nbsp; Before him, in the glimmering light of the mystic
Southern Cross, the great river crept unctuously, silently to the sea.&nbsp;
It seemed to be stealing away surreptitiously while the forest whispered
of it.&nbsp; On its surface the reflection of the great stars of the
southern hemisphere ran into little streaks of silver, shimmering away
into darkness.</p>
<p>All sound of human life was still.&nbsp; The natives were asleep.&nbsp;
In the next room, Joseph in his hammock was just on the barrier between
the waking and the sleeping life&mdash;as soldiers learn to be.&nbsp;
Oscard would not have needed to raise his voice to call him to his side.</p>
<p>The leader of this hurried retreat had been sitting there for two
hours.&nbsp; The slimy moving surface of the river had entered into
his brain; the restless silence of the African forest alone kept him
awake.&nbsp; He hardly realised that the sound momentarily gaining strength
within his ears was that of a paddle&mdash;a single, weakly, irregular
paddle.&nbsp; It was not a sound to wake a sleeping man.&nbsp; It came
so slowly, so gently through the whisper of the dripping leaves that
it would enter into his slumbers and make itself part of them.</p>
<p>Guy Oscard only realised the meaning of that sound when a black shadow
crept on to the smooth evenness of the river&rsquo;s breast.&nbsp; Oscard
was eminently a man of action.&nbsp; In a moment he was on his feet,
and in the darkness of the room there was the gleam of a rifle-barrel.&nbsp;
He came back to the window&mdash;watching.</p>
<p>He saw the canoe approach the bank.&nbsp; He heard the thud of the
paddle as it was thrown upon the ground.&nbsp; In the gloom, to which
his eyes were accustomed, he saw a man step from the boat to the shore
and draw the canoe up.&nbsp; The silent midnight visitor then turned
and walked up towards the house.&nbsp; There was something familiar
in the gait&mdash;the legs were slightly bowed.&nbsp; The man was walking
with great difficulty, staggering a little at each step.&nbsp; He seemed
to be in great pain.</p>
<p>Guy Oscard laid aside his rifle.&nbsp; He stepped forward to the
open window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Durnovo?&rdquo; he said, without raising his
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the other.&nbsp; His voice was muffled,
as if his tongue was swollen, and there was a startling break in it.</p>
<p>Oscard stepped aside, and Durnovo passed into his own house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got a light?&rdquo; he said, in the same muffled way.</p>
<p>In the next room Joseph could be heard striking a match, and a moment
later he entered the room, throwing a flood of light before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Good God</i>!&rdquo; cried Guy Oscard.&nbsp; He stepped
back as if he had been struck, with his hand shielding his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save us!&rdquo; ejaculated Joseph in the same breath.</p>
<p>The thing that stood there&mdash;sickening their gaze&mdash;was not
a human being at all.&nbsp; Take a man&rsquo;s eyelids away, leaving
the round balls staring, blood-streaked; cut away his lips, leaving
the grinning teeth and red gums; shear off his ears&mdash;that which
is left is not a man at all.&nbsp; This had been done to Victor Durnovo.&nbsp;
Truly the vengeance of man is crueller than the vengeance of God!</p>
<p>Could he have seen himself, Victor Durnovo would never have shown
that face&mdash;or what remained of it&mdash;to a human being.&nbsp;
He could only have killed himself.&nbsp; Who can tell what cruelties
had been paid for, piece by piece, in this loathsome mutilation?&nbsp;
The slaves had wreaked their terrible vengeance; but the greatest, the
deepest, the most inhuman cruelty was in letting him go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve made a pretty mess of me,&rdquo; said Durnovo
in a sickening, lifeless voice&mdash;and he stood there, with a terrible
caricature of a grin.</p>
<p>Joseph set down the lamp with a groan, and went back into the dark
room beyond, where he cast himself upon the ground and buried his face
in his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; he muttered.&nbsp; &ldquo;O God in heaven&mdash;kill
it, kill it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy Oscard never attempted to run away from it.&nbsp; He stood slowly
gulping down his nauseating horror.&nbsp; His teeth were clenched; his
face, through the sunburn, livid; the blue of his eyes seemed to have
faded into an ashen grey.&nbsp; The sight he was looking on would have
sent three men out of five into gibbering idiocy.</p>
<p>Then at last he moved forward.&nbsp; With averted eyes he took Durnovo
by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;lie down upon my bed.&nbsp; I
will try and help you.&nbsp; Can you take some food?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Durnovo threw himself down heavily on the bed.&nbsp; There was a
punishment sufficient to expiate all his sins in the effort he saw that
Guy Oscard had had to make before he touched him.&nbsp; He turned his
face away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t eaten anything for twenty-four hours,&rdquo;
he said, with a whistling intonation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joseph,&rdquo; said Oscard, returning to the door of the inner
room&mdash;his voice sounded different, there was a metallic ring in
it&mdash;&ldquo;get something for Mr. Durnovo&mdash;some soup or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joseph obeyed, shaking as if ague were in his bones.</p>
<p>Oscard administered the soup.&nbsp; He tended Durnovo with all the
gentleness of a woman, and a fortitude that was above the fortitude
of men.&nbsp; Despite himself, his hands trembled&mdash;big and strong
as they were; his whole being was contracted with horror and pain.&nbsp;
Whatever Victor Durnovo had been, he was now an object of such pity
that before it all possible human sins faded into spotlessness.&nbsp;
There was no crime in all that human nature has found to commit for
which such cruelty as this would be justly meted out in punishment.</p>
<p>Durnovo spoke from time to time, but he could see the effect that
his hissing speech had upon his companion, and in time he gave it up.&nbsp;
He told haltingly of the horrors of the Simiacine Plateau&mdash;of the
last grim tragedy acted there&mdash;how, at last, blinded with his blood,
maimed, stupefied by agony, he had been hounded down the slope by a
yelling, laughing horde of torturers.</p>
<p>There was not much to be done, and presently Guy Oscard moved away
to his camp-chair, where he sat staring into the night.&nbsp; Sleep
was impossible.&nbsp; Strong, hardened, weather-beaten man that he was,
his nerves were all a-tingle, his flesh creeping and jumping with horror.&nbsp;
Gradually he collected his faculties enough to begin to think about
the future.&nbsp; What was he to do with this man?&nbsp; He could not
take him to Loango.&nbsp; He could not risk that Jocelyn or even Maurice
Gordon should look upon this horror.</p>
<p>Joseph had crept back into the inner room, where he had no light,
and could be heard breathing hard, wide awake in his hammock.</p>
<p>Suddenly the silence was broken by a loud cry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oscard!&nbsp; Oscard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a moment Joseph and Oscard were at the bedside.</p>
<p>Durnovo was sitting up, and he grabbed at Oscard&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s
sake, man, don&rsquo;t let me go to sleep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Oscard.&nbsp; They both thought
that he had gone mad.&nbsp; Sleep had nothing more to do with Durnovo&rsquo;s
eyes&mdash;protruding, staring, terrible to look at.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me go to sleep,&rdquo; he repeated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Oscard soothingly; &ldquo;all right.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ll look after you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fell back on the bed.&nbsp; In the flickering light his eyeballs
gleamed.</p>
<p>Then quite suddenly he rose to a sitting position again with a wild
effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got it!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sleeping sickness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two listeners knew of this strange disease.&nbsp; Oscard had
seen a whole village devastated by it, the habitants lying about their
own doors, stricken down by a deadly sleep from which they never woke.&nbsp;
It is known on the West Coast of Africa, and the cure for it is unknown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold me!&rdquo; cried Durnovo.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let
me sleep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His head fell forward even as he spoke, and the staring wide-open
eyes that could not sleep made a horror of him.</p>
<p>Oscard took him by the arms, and held him in a sitting position.&nbsp;
Durnovo&rsquo;s fingers were clutching at his sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shake me!&nbsp; God! shake me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Oscard took him in his strong arms, and set him on his feet.&nbsp;
He shook him gently at first, but as the dread somnolence crept on he
shook harder, until the mutilated inhuman head rolled upon the shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sin to let that man live,&rdquo; exclaimed Joseph,
turning away in horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sin to let <i>any</i> man die,&rdquo; replied
Oscard, and with his great strength he shook Durnovo like a garment.</p>
<p>And so Victor Durnovo died.&nbsp; His stained soul left his body
in Guy Oscard&rsquo;s hands, and the big Englishman shook the corpse,
trying to awake it from that sleep which knows no earthly waking.</p>
<p>So, after all, Heaven stepped in and laid its softening hand on the
judgment of men.&nbsp; But there was a strange irony in the mode of
death.&nbsp; It was strange that this man, who never could have closed
his eyes again, should have been stricken down by the sleeping sickness.</p>
<p>They laid the body on the floor, and covered the face, which was
less gruesome in death, for the pity of the eyes had given place to
peace.</p>
<p>The morning light, bursting suddenly through the trees as it does
in Equatorial Africa, showed the room set in order and Guy Oscard sleeping
in his camp-chair.&nbsp; Behind him, on the floor, lay the form of Victor
Durnovo.&nbsp; Joseph, less iron-nerved than the great big-game hunter,
was awake and astir with the dawn.&nbsp; He, too, was calmer now.&nbsp;
He had seen death face to face too often to be appalled by it in broad
daylight.</p>
<p>So they buried Victor Durnovo between the two giant palms at Msala,
with his feet turned towards the river which he had made his, as if
ready to arise when the call comes and undertake one of those marvellous
journeys of his which are yet a household word on the West Coast.</p>
<p>The cloth fluttered as they lowered him into his narrow resting-place,
and the face they covered had a strange mystic grin, as if he saw something
that they could not perceive.&nbsp; Perhaps he did.&nbsp; Perhaps he
saw the Simiacine Plateau, and knew that, after all, he had won the
last throw; for up there, far above the table-lands of Central Africa,
there lay beneath high Heaven a charnel-house.&nbsp; Hounded down the
slope by his tormentors, he had left a memento behind him surer than
their torturing knives, keener than their sharpest steel&mdash;he had
left the sleeping sickness behind him.</p>
<p>His last journey had been worthy of his reputation.&nbsp; In twenty
days he had covered the distance between the Plateau and Msala, stumbling
on alone, blinded, wounded, sore-stricken, through a thousand daily
valleys of death.&nbsp; With wonderful endurance he had paddled night
and day down the sleek river without rest, with the dread microbe of
the sleeping sickness slowly creeping through his veins.</p>
<p>He had lived in dread of this disease, as men do of a sickness which
clutches them at last; but when it came he did not recognise it.&nbsp;
He was so racked by pain that he never recognised the symptoms; he was
so panic-stricken, so paralysed by the nameless fear that lay behind
him, that he could only think of pressing forward.&nbsp; In the night
hours he would suddenly rise from his precarious bed under the shadow
of a fallen tree and stagger on, haunted by a picture of his ruthless
foes pressing through the jungle in pursuit.&nbsp; Thus he accomplished
his wonderful journey alone through trackless forests; thus he fended
off the sickness which gripped him the moment that he laid him down
to rest.</p>
<p>He had left it&mdash;a grim legacy&mdash;to his torturers, and before
he reached the river all was still on the Simiacine Plateau.</p>
<p>And so we leave Victor Durnovo.&nbsp; His sins are buried with him,
and beneath the giant palms at Msala lies Maurice Gordon&rsquo;s secret.</p>
<p>And so we leave Msala, the accursed camp.&nbsp; Far up the Ogowe
river, on the left bank, the giant palms still stand sentry, and beneath
their shade the crumbling walls of a cursed house are slowly disappearing
beneath luxuriant growths of grass and brushwood.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX.&nbsp; THE EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Yet I think at God&rsquo;s Tribunal<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some
large answer you shall hear.</i></p>
<p>In a dimly-lighted room in the bungalow at Loango two women had been
astir all night.&nbsp; Now, as dawn approached, one of them, worn out
with watching, wearied with that blessed fatigue of anxiety which dulls
the senses, had laid her down on the curtain-covered bed to sleep.</p>
<p>While Marie slept Jocelyn Gordon walked softly backwards and forwards
with Nestorius in her arms.&nbsp; Nestorius was probably dying.&nbsp;
He lay in the Englishwoman&rsquo;s gentle arms&mdash;a little brown
bundle of flexile limbs and cotton night-shirt.&nbsp; It was terribly
hot.&nbsp; All day the rain had been pending; all night it had held
off until the whole earth seemed to pulsate with the desire for relief.&nbsp;
Jocelyn kept moving, so that the changing air wafted over the little
bare limbs might allay the fever.&nbsp; She was in evening dress, having,
indeed, been called from the drawing-room by Marie; and the child&rsquo;s
woolly black head was pressed against her breast as if to seek relief
from the inward pressure on the awakening brain.</p>
<p>A missionary possessing some small knowledge of medicine had been
with them until midnight, and, having done his best, had gone away,
leaving the child to the two women.&nbsp; Maurice had been in twice,
clumsily, on tiptoe, to look with ill-concealed awe at the child, and
to whisper hopes to Marie which displayed a ludicrous, if lamentable,
ignorance of what he was talking about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little chap&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sure of it.&nbsp; See, Marie, his eyes are brighter.&nbsp; Devilish
hot, though, isn&rsquo;t he&mdash;poor little soul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he stood about, awkwardly sympathetic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything I can do for you, Jocelyn?&rdquo; he asked, and then
departed, only too pleased to get away from the impending calamity.</p>
<p>Marie was not emotional.&nbsp; She seemed to have left all emotion
behind, in some other phase of her life which was shut off from the
present by a thick curtain.&nbsp; She was patient and calm, but she
was not so clever with the child as was Jocelyn.&nbsp; Perhaps her greater
experience acted as a handicap in her execution of those small offices
to the sick which may be rendered useless at any moment.&nbsp; Perhaps
she knew that Nestorius was wanted elsewhere.&nbsp; Or it may only have
been that Jocelyn was able to soothe him sooner, because there is an
unwritten law that those who love us best are not always the best nurses
for us.</p>
<p>When, at last, sleep came to the child, it was in Jocelyn&rsquo;s
arms that he lay with that utter abandonment of pose which makes a sleeping
infant and a sleeping kitten more graceful than any living thing.&nbsp;
Marie leant over Nestorius until her dusky cheek almost touched Jocelyn&rsquo;s
fair English one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is asleep,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>And her great dark eyes probed Jocelyn&rsquo;s face as if wondering
whether her arms, bearing that burden, told her that this was the last
sleep.</p>
<p>Jocelyn nodded gravely, and continued the gentle swaying motion affected
by women under such circumstances.</p>
<p>Nestorius continued to sleep, and at last Marie, overcome by sleep
herself, lay down on her bed.</p>
<p>Thus it came about that the dawn found Jocelyn moving softly in the
room, with Nestorius asleep in her arms.&nbsp; A pink light came creeping
through the trees, presently turning to a golden yellow, and, behold!
it was light.&nbsp; It was a little cooler, for the sea-breeze had set
in.&nbsp; The cool air from the surface of the water was rushing inland
to supply the place of the heated atmosphere rising towards the sun.&nbsp;
With the breeze came the increased murmur of the distant surf.&nbsp;
The dull continuous sound seemed to live amidst the summits of the trees
far above the low-built house.&nbsp; It rose and fell with a long-drawn,
rhythmic swing.&nbsp; Already the sounds of life were mingling with
it&mdash;the low of a cow&mdash;the crowing of the cocks&mdash;the hum
of the noisier daylight insect-life.</p>
<p>Jocelyn moved to the window, and her heart suddenly leapt to her
throat.</p>
<p>On the brown turf in front of the house were two men, stretched side
by side, as if other hands had laid them there, dead.&nbsp; One man
was much bigger than the other.&nbsp; He was of exceptional stature.&nbsp;
Jocelyn recognised them almost immediately&mdash;Guy Oscard and Joseph.&nbsp;
They had arrived during the night, and, not wishing to disturb the sleeping
household, had lain them down in the front garden to sleep with a quiet
conscience beneath the stars.&nbsp; The action was so startlingly characteristic,
so suggestive of the primeval, simple man whom Oscard represented as
one born out of time, that Jocelyn laughed suddenly.</p>
<p>While she was still at the window, Marie rose and came to her side.&nbsp;
Nestorius was still sleeping.&nbsp; Following the direction of her mistress&rsquo;s
eyes, Marie saw the two men.&nbsp; Joseph was sleeping on his face,
after the manner of Thomas Atkins all the world over.&nbsp; Guy Oscard
lay on his side, with his head on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so like Mr. Oscard,&rdquo; said Marie, with her patient
smile, &ldquo;so like&mdash;so like.&nbsp; It could be no other man&mdash;to
do a thing like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jocelyn gave Nestorius back to his mother, and the two women stood
for a moment looking out at the sleepers, little knowing what the advent
of these two men brought with it for one of them.&nbsp; Then the Englishwoman
went to change her dress, awaking her brother as she passed his room.</p>
<p>It was not long before Maurice Gordon had hospitably awakened the
travellers and brought them in to change their torn and ragged clothes
for something more presentable.&nbsp; It would appear that Nestorius
was not particular.&nbsp; He did not mind dying on the kitchen table
if need be.&nbsp; His mother deposited him on this table on a pillow,
while she prepared the breakfast with that patient resignation which
seemed to emanate from having tasted of the worst that the world has
to give.</p>
<p>Joseph was ready the first, and he promptly repaired to the kitchen,
where he set to work to help Marie, with his customary energy.</p>
<p>It was Marie who first perceived a difference in Nestorius.&nbsp;
His dusky little face was shining with a sudden, weakening perspiration,
his limbs lay lifelessly, with a lack of their usual comfortable-looking
grace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; she said quickly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fetch Miss Gordon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jocelyn came, and Maurice and Guy Oscard; for they had been together
in the dining-room when Joseph delivered Marie&rsquo;s message.</p>
<p>Nestorius was wide awake now.&nbsp; When he saw Oscard his small
face suddenly expanded into a brilliant grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad case!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>It was rather startling, until Marie spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thinks you are Mr. Meredith,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr.
Meredith taught him to say &lsquo;Bad case!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nestorius looked from one to the other with gravely speculative eyes,
which presently closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is dying&mdash;yes!&rdquo; said the mother, looking at
Jocelyn.</p>
<p>Oscard knew more of this matter than any of them.&nbsp; He went forward
and leant over the table.&nbsp; Marie removed a piece of salted bacon
that was lying on the table near to the pillow.&nbsp; With the unconsciousness
of long habit she swept some crumbs away with her apron.&nbsp; Oscard
was trying to find the pulse in the tiny wrist, but there was not much
to find.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid he is very ill,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>At this moment the kettle boiled over, and Marie had to turn away
to attend to her duties.</p>
<p>When she came back Oscard was looking, not at Nestorius, but at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We spent four days at Msala,&rdquo; he said, in a tone that
meant that he had more to tell her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The place is in ruins, as you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded with a peculiar little twist of the lips as if he were
hurting her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am afraid I have some bad news for you.&nbsp; Victor
Durnovo, your master&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;tell quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is dead.&nbsp; We buried him at Msala.&nbsp; He died in
my arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment Joseph gave a little gasp and turned away to the window,
where he stood with his broad back turned towards them.&nbsp; Maurice
Gordon, as white as death, was leaning against the table.&nbsp; He quite
forgot himself.&nbsp; His lips were apart, his jaw had dropped; he was
hanging breathlessly on Guy Oscard&rsquo;s next word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He died of the sleeping sickness,&rdquo; said Oscard.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We had come down to Msala before him&mdash;Joseph and I.&nbsp;
I broke up the partnership, and we left him in possession of the Simiacine
Plateau.&nbsp; But his men turned against him.&nbsp; For some reason
his authority over them failed.&nbsp; He was obliged to make a dash
for Msala, and he reached it, but the sickness was upon him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maurice Gordon drew a sharp sigh of relief which was almost a sob.&nbsp;
Marie was standing with her two hands on the pillow where Nestorius
lay.&nbsp; Her deep eyes were fixed on the Englishman&rsquo;s sunburnt,
strongly gentle face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he send a message for me&mdash;yes?&rdquo; she said softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Oscard.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&mdash;there was
no time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joseph at the window had turned half round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was my husband,&rdquo; said Marie in her clear, deep tones;
&ldquo;the father of this little one, which you call Nestorius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oscard bowed his head without surprise.&nbsp; Jocelyn was standing
still as a statue, with her hand on the dying infant&rsquo;s cheek.&nbsp;
No one dared to look at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all right,&rdquo; said Marie bluntly.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
were married at Sierra Leone by the English chaplain.&nbsp; My father,
who is dead, kept a hotel at Sierra Leone, and he knew the ways of the&mdash;half-castes.&nbsp;
He said that the Protestant Church at Sierra Leone was good enough for
him, and we were married there.&nbsp; And then Victor brought me away
from my people to this place and to Msala.&nbsp; Then he got tired of
me&mdash;he cared no more.&nbsp; He said I was ugly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pronounced it &ldquo;ogly,&rdquo; and seemed to think that the
story finished there.&nbsp; At all events, she added nothing to it.&nbsp;
But Joseph thought fit to contribute a <i>post scriptum.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better tell &rsquo;em, mistress,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;that he tried to starve yer and them kids&mdash;that he wanted
to leave yer at Msala to be massacred by the tribes, only Mr. Oscard
sent yer down &rsquo;ere.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d better tell &rsquo;em that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied, with a faint smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,
because he was my husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy Oscard was looking very hard at Joseph, and, catching his eye,
made a little gesture commanding silence.&nbsp; He did not want him
to say too much.</p>
<p>Joseph turned away again to the window, and stood thus, apart, till
the end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt,&rdquo; said Oscard to Marie, &ldquo;that
he would have sent some message to you had he been able; but he was
very ill&mdash;he was dying&mdash;when he reached Msala.&nbsp; It was
wonderful that he got there at all.&nbsp; We did what we could for him,
but it was hopeless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie raised her shoulders with her pathetic gesture of resignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sleeping sickness,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what will you?&nbsp;
There is no remedy.&nbsp; He always said he would die of that.&nbsp;
He feared it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the greater sorrow she seemed to have forgotten her child, who
was staring open-eyed at the ceiling.&nbsp; The two others&mdash;the
boy and girl&mdash;were playing on the doorstep with some unconsidered
trifles from the dust-heap&mdash;after the manner of children all the
world over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was not a good man,&rdquo; said Marie, turning to Jocelyn,
as if she alone of all present would understand.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was
not a good husband, but&mdash;&rdquo; she shrugged her shoulders with
one of her patient, shadowy smiles&mdash;&ldquo;it makes so little difference&mdash;yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jocelyn said nothing.&nbsp; None of them had aught to say to her.&nbsp;
For each in that room could lay a separate sin at Victor Durnovo&rsquo;s
door.&nbsp; He was gone beyond the reach of human justice to the Higher
Court where the Extenuating Circumstance is fully understood.&nbsp;
The generosity of that silence was infectious, and they told her nothing.&nbsp;
Had they spoken she would perforce have believed them; but then, as
she herself said, it would have made &ldquo;so little difference.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So Victor Durnovo leaves these pages, and all we can do is to remember
the writing on the ground.&nbsp; Who amongst us dares to withhold the
Extenuating Circumstance?&nbsp; Who is ready to leave this world without
that crutch to lean upon?&nbsp; Given a mixed blood&mdash;evil black
with evil white and what can the result be but evil?&nbsp; Given the
climate of Western Africa and the mental irritation thereof, added to
a lack of education and the natural vice inherent in man, and you have&mdash;Victor
Durnovo.</p>
<p>Nestorius&mdash;the shameless&mdash;stretched out his little bare
limbs and turned half over on his side.&nbsp; He looked from one face
to the other with the grave wonder that was his.&nbsp; He had never
been taken much notice of.&nbsp; His short walks in life had been very
near the ground, where trifles look very large, and from whence those
larger stumbling-blocks which occupy our attention are quite invisible.&nbsp;
He had been the third&mdash;the solitary third child who usually makes
his own interest in life, and is left by or leaves the rest of his family.</p>
<p>It was not quite clear to him why he was the centre of so much attention.&nbsp;
His mind did not run to the comprehension of the fact that he was the
wearer of borrowed plumes&mdash;the sable plumes of King Death.</p>
<p>He had always wanted to get on to the kitchen table&mdash;there was
much there that interested him, and supplied him with food for thought.&nbsp;
He had risked his life on more than one occasion in attempts to scale
that height with the assistance of a saucepan that turned over and poured
culinary delicacies on his toes, or perhaps a sleeping cat that got
up and walked away much annoyed.&nbsp; And now that he was at last at
this dizzy height he was sorry to find that he was too tired to crawl
about and explore the vast possibilities of it.&nbsp; He was rather
too tired to convey his forefinger to his mouth, and was forced to work
out mental problems without that aid to thought.</p>
<p>Presently his eyes fell on Guy Oscard&rsquo;s face, and again his
own small features expanded into a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad case!&rdquo; he said, and, turning over, he nestled down
into the pillow, and he had the answer to the many questions that puzzled
his small brain.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XL.&nbsp; SIR JOHN&rsquo;S LAST CARD</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>&rsquo;Tis better playing with a
lion&rsquo;s whelp<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than with an old
one dying.</i></p>
<p>As through an opera runs the rhythm of one dominant air, so through
men&rsquo;s lives there rings a dominant note, soft in youth, strong
in manhood, and soft again in old age.&nbsp; But it is always there,
and whether soft in the gentler periods, or strong amidst the noise
and clang of the perihelion, it dominates always and gives its tone
to the whole life.</p>
<p>The dominant tone of Sir John Meredith&rsquo;s existence had been
the high clear note of battle.&nbsp; He had always found something or
some one to fight from the very beginning, and now, in his old age,
he was fighting still.&nbsp; His had never been the din and crash of
warfare by sword and cannon, but the subtler, deeper combat of the pen.&nbsp;
In his active days he had got through a vast amount of work&mdash;that
unchronicled work of the Foreign Office which never comes, through the
cheap newspapers, to the voracious maw of a chattering public.&nbsp;
His name was better known on the banks of the Neva, the Seine, the Bosphorus,
or the swift-rolling Iser than by the Thames; and grim Sir John was
content to have it so.</p>
<p>His face had never been public property, the comic papers had never
used his personality as a peg upon which to hang their ever-changing
political principles.&nbsp; But he had always been &ldquo;there,&rdquo;
as he himself vaguely put it.&nbsp; That is to say, he had always been
at the back&mdash;one of those invisible powers of the stage by whose
command the scene is shifted, the lights are lowered for the tragedy,
or the gay music plays on the buffoon.&nbsp; Sir John had no sympathy
with a generation of men and women who would rather be laughed at and
despised than unnoticed.&nbsp; He belonged to an age wherein it was
held better to be a gentleman than the object of a cheap and evanescent
notoriety&mdash;and he was at once the despair and the dread of newspaper
interviewers, enterprising publishers, and tuft-hunters.</p>
<p>He was so little known out of his own select circle that the porters
in Euston Station asked each other in vain who the old swell waiting
for the four o&rsquo;clock &ldquo;up&rdquo; from Liverpool could be.&nbsp;
The four o&rsquo;clock was, moreover, not the first express which Sir
John had met that day.&nbsp; His stately carriage-and-pair had pushed
its way into the crowd of smaller and humbler vehicular fry earlier
in the afternoon, and on that occasion also the old gentleman had indulged
in a grave promenade upon the platform.</p>
<p>He was walking up and down there now, with his hand in the small
of his back, where of late he had been aware of a constant aching pain.&nbsp;
He was very upright, however, and supremely unconscious of the curiosity
aroused by his presence in the mind of the station <i>canaille</i>.&nbsp;
His lips were rather more troublesome than usual, and his keen eyes
twinkled with a suppressed excitement.</p>
<p>In former days there had been no one equal to him in certain diplomatic
crises where it was a question of brow-beating suavely the uppish representative
of some foreign State.&nbsp; No man could then rival him in the insolently
aristocratic school of diplomacy which England has made her own.&nbsp;
But in his most dangerous crisis he had never been restless, apprehensive,
pessimistic, as he was at this moment.&nbsp; And after all it was a
very simple matter that had brought him there.&nbsp; It was merely the
question of meeting a man as if by accident, and then afterwards making
that man do certain things required of him.&nbsp; Moreover, the man
was only Guy Oscard&mdash;learned if you will in forest craft, but a
mere child in the hand of so old a diplomatist as Sir John Meredith.</p>
<p>That which made Sir John so uneasy was the abiding knowledge that
Jack&rsquo;s wedding-day would dawn in twelve hours.&nbsp; The margin
was much too small, through, however, no fault of Sir John&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
The West African steamer had been delayed&mdash;unaccountably&mdash;two
days.&nbsp; A third day lost in the Atlantic would have overthrown Sir
John Meredith&rsquo;s plan.&nbsp; He had often cut things fine before,
but somehow now&mdash;not that he was getting old, oh no!&mdash;but
somehow the suspense was too much for his nerves.&nbsp; He soon became
irritated and distrustful.&nbsp; Besides the pain in his back wearied
him and interfered with the clear sequence of his thoughts.</p>
<p>The owners of the West African steamer had telegraphed that the passengers
had left for London in two separate trains.&nbsp; Guy Oscard was not
in the first&mdash;there was no positive reason why he should be in
the second.&nbsp; More depended upon his being in this second express
than Sir John cared to contemplate.</p>
<p>The course of his peregrinations brought him into the vicinity of
an inspector whose attitude betokened respect while his presence raised
hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there any reason to suppose that your train is coming?&rdquo;
he inquired of the official.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Signalled now, my lord,&rdquo; replied the inspector, touching
his cap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what does that mean?&rdquo; uncompromisingly ignorant
of technical parlance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be in in one minute, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John&rsquo;s hand was over his lips as he walked back to the
carriage, casting as it were the commander&rsquo;s eye over the field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the crowd is round the train you come and look for me,&rdquo;
he said to the footman, who touched his cockaded hat in silence.</p>
<p>At that moment the train lumbered in, the engine wearing that inanely
self-important air affected by locomotives of the larger build.&nbsp;
From all quarters an army of porters besieged the platform, and in a
few seconds Sir John was in the centre of an agitated crowd.&nbsp; There
was one other calm man on that platform&mdash;another man with no parcels,
whom no one sought to embrace.&nbsp; His brown face and close-cropped
head towered above a sea of agitated bonnets.&nbsp; Sir John, whose
walk in life had been through crowds, elbowed his way forward and deliberately
walked against Guy Oscard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&mdash;n it!&rdquo; he exclaimed, turning round.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah&mdash;Mr.
Oscard&mdash;how d&rsquo;ye do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; replied Guy Oscard, really glad to see
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a good man for a crowd; I think I will follow in your
wake,&rdquo; said Sir John.&nbsp; &ldquo;A number of people&mdash;of
the baser sort.&nbsp; Got my carriage here somewhere.&nbsp; Fool of
a man looking for me in the wrong place, no doubt.&nbsp; Where are you
going?&nbsp; May I offer you a lift?&nbsp; This way.&nbsp; Here, John,
take Mr. Oscard&rsquo;s parcels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could not have done it better in his keenest day.&nbsp; Guy Oscard
was seated in the huge, roomy carriage before he had realised what had
happened to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your man will look after your traps, I suppose?&rdquo; said
Sir John, hospitably drawing the fur rug from the opposite seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Guy, &ldquo;although he is not my man.&nbsp;
He is Jack&rsquo;s man, Joseph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, of course; excellent servant, too.&nbsp; Jack told me
he had left him with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John leant out of the window and asked the footman whether he
knew his colleague Joseph, and upon receiving an answer in the affirmative
he gave orders&mdash;acting as Guy&rsquo;s mouthpiece&mdash;that the
luggage was to be conveyed to Russell Square.&nbsp; While these orders
were being executed the two men sat waiting in the carriage, and Sir
John lost no time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to have this opportunity
of thanking you for all your kindness to my son in this wild expedition
of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Oscard, with a transparent reserve which
rather puzzled Sir John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must excuse me,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, sitting
rather stiffly, &ldquo;if I appear to take a somewhat limited interest
in this great Simiacine discovery, of which there has been considerable
talk in some circles.&nbsp; The limit to my interest is drawn by a lamentable
ignorance.&nbsp; I am afraid the business details are rather unintelligible
to me.&nbsp; My son has endeavoured, somewhat cursorily perhaps, to
explain the matter to me, but I have never mastered the&mdash;er&mdash;commercial
technicalities.&nbsp; However, I understand that you have made quite
a mint of money, which is the chief consideration&mdash;nowadays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew the rug more closely round his knees and looked out of the
window, deeply interested in a dispute between two cabmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;we have been very successful,&rdquo; said Oscard.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How is your son now?&nbsp; When I last saw him he was in a very
bad way.&nbsp; Indeed, I hardly expected to see him again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John was still interested in the dispute, which was not yet settled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is well, thank you.&nbsp; You know that he is going to
be married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me that he was engaged,&rdquo; replied Oscard; &ldquo;but
I did not know that anything definite was fixed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most definite thing of all is fixed&mdash;the date.&nbsp;
It is to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; You have not much time to prepare your wedding
garments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied Oscard, with a laugh, &ldquo;I have not
been bidden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect the invitation is awaiting you at your house.&nbsp;
No doubt my son will want you to be present&mdash;they would both like
you to be there, no doubt.&nbsp; But come with me now; we will call
and see Jack.&nbsp; I know where to find him.&nbsp; In fact, I have
an appointment with him at a quarter to five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may seem strange that Guy Oscard should not have asked the name
of his friend&rsquo;s prospective bride, but Sir John was ready for
that.&nbsp; He gave his companion no time.&nbsp; Whenever he opened
his lips Sir John turned Oscard&rsquo;s thoughts aside.</p>
<p>What he had told him was strictly true.&nbsp; He had an appointment
with Jack&mdash;an appointment of his own making.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, in pursuance of his policy of choking
questions, &ldquo;he is wonderfully well, as you will see for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oscard submitted silently to this high-handed arrangement.&nbsp;
He had not known Sir John well.&nbsp; Indeed, all his intercourse with
him has been noted in these pages.&nbsp; He was rather surprised to
find him so talkative and so very friendly.&nbsp; But Guy Oscard was
not a very deep person.&nbsp; He was sublimely indifferent to the Longdrawn
Motive.&nbsp; He presumed that Sir John made friends of his son&rsquo;s
friends; and in his straightforward acceptance of facts he was perfectly
well aware that by his timely rescue he had saved Jack Meredith from
the hands of the tribes.&nbsp; The presumption was that Sir John knew
of this, and it was only natural that he should be somewhat exceptionally
gracious to the man who had saved his son&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>It would seem that Sir John divined these thoughts, for he presently
spoke of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Owing to an unfortunate difference of opinion with my son
we have not been very communicative lately,&rdquo; he said, with that
deliberation which he knew how to assume when he desired to be heard
without interruption.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am therefore almost entirely ignorant
of your African affairs, but I imagine Jack owes more to your pluck
and promptness than has yet transpired.&nbsp; I gathered as much from
one or two conversations I had with Miss Gordon when she was in England.&nbsp;
I am one of Miss Gordon&rsquo;s many admirers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am another,&rdquo; said Oscard frankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Then you are happy enough to be the object of a
reciprocal feeling which for myself I could scarcely expect.&nbsp; She
spoke of you in no measured language.&nbsp; I gathered from her that
if you had not acted with great promptitude the&mdash;er&mdash;happy
event of to-morrow could not have taken place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man paused, and Guy Oscard, who looked somewhat distressed
and distinctly uncomfortable, could find no graceful way of changing
the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a word,&rdquo; went on Sir John in a very severe tone,
&ldquo;I owe you a great debt.&nbsp; You saved my boy&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you see,&rdquo; argued Oscard, finding his tongue
at last, &ldquo;out there things like that don&rsquo;t count for so
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;&nbsp; There was the suggestion
of a smile beneath Sir John&rsquo;s grim eyebrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned Oscard rather lamely, &ldquo;it is a sort
of thing that happens every day out there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John turned suddenly, and with the courtliness that was ever
his he indulged in a rare exhibition of feeling.&nbsp; He laid his hand
on Guy Oscard&rsquo;s stalwart knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Oscard,&rdquo; he said, and when he chose he could
render his voice very soft and affectionate, &ldquo;none of these arguments
apply to me because I am not out there.&nbsp; I like you for trying
to make little of your exploit.&nbsp; Such conduct is worthy of you&mdash;worthy
of a gentleman; but you cannot disguise the fact that Jack owes his
life to you and I owe you the same, which, between you and me I may
mention, is more valuable to me than my own.&nbsp; I want you to remember
always that I am your debtor, and if&mdash;if circumstances should ever
seem to indicate that the feeling I have for you is anything but friendly
and kind, do me the honour of disbelieving those indications&mdash;you
understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Oscard untruthfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are at Lady Cantourne&rsquo;s,&rdquo; continued Sir
John, &ldquo;where, as it happens, I expect to meet Jack.&nbsp; Her
ladyship is naturally interested in the affair of to-morrow, and has
kindly undertaken to keep us up to date in our behaviour.&nbsp; You
will come in with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oscard remembered afterwards that he was rather puzzled&mdash;that
there was perhaps in his simple mind the faintest tinge of a suspicion.&nbsp;
At the moment, however, there was no time to do anything but follow.&nbsp;
The man had already rung the bell, and Lady Cantourne&rsquo;s butler
was holding the door open.&nbsp; There was something in his attitude
vaguely suggestive of expectation.&nbsp; He never took his eyes from
Sir John Meredith&rsquo;s face, as if on the alert for an unspoken order.</p>
<p>Guy Oscard followed his companion into the hall, and the very scent
of the house&mdash;for each house speaks to more senses than one&mdash;made
his heart leap in his broad breast.&nbsp; It seemed as if Millicent&rsquo;s
presence was in the very air.&nbsp; This was more than he could have
hoped.&nbsp; He had not intended to call this afternoon, although the
visit was only to have been postponed for twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>Sir John Meredith&rsquo;s face was a marvel to see.&nbsp; It was
quite steady.&nbsp; He was upright and alert, with all the intrepidity
of his mind up in arms.&nbsp; There was a light in his eyes&mdash;a
gleam of light from other days, not yet burnt out.</p>
<p>He laid aside his gold-headed cane and threw back his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Mr. Meredith upstairs?&rdquo; he said to the butler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man moved towards the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not come!&rdquo; said Sir John, holding up his hand.</p>
<p>The butler stood aside and Sir John led the way up to the drawing-room.</p>
<p>At the door he paused for a moment.&nbsp; Guy Oscard was at his heels.&nbsp;
Then he opened the door rather slowly, and motioned gracefully with
his left hand to Oscard to pass in before him.</p>
<p>Oscard stepped forward.&nbsp; When he had crossed the threshold Sir
John closed the door sharply behind him and turned to go downstairs.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XLI.&nbsp; &Agrave; TROIS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Men serve women kneeling; when they
get on their feet they go away.</i></p>
<p>Guy Oscard stood for a moment on the threshold.&nbsp; He heard the
door close behind him, and he took two steps farther forward.</p>
<p>Jack Meredith and Millicent were at the fireplace.&nbsp; There was
a heap of disordered paper and string upon the table, and a few wedding
presents standing in the midst of their packing.</p>
<p>Millicent&rsquo;s pretty face was quite white.&nbsp; She looked from
Meredith to Oscard with a sudden horror in her eyes.&nbsp; For the first
time in her life she was at a loss&mdash;quite taken aback.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-h!&rdquo; she whispered, and that was all.</p>
<p>The silence that followed was tense as if something in the atmosphere
was about to snap; and in the midst of it the wheels of Sir John&rsquo;s
retreating carriage came to the ears of the three persons in the drawing-room.</p>
<p>It was only for a moment, but in that moment the two men saw clearly.&nbsp;
It was as if the veil from the girl&rsquo;s mind had fallen&mdash;leaving
her thoughts confessed, bare before them.&nbsp; In the same instant
they both saw&mdash;they both sped back in thought to their first meeting,
to the hundred links of the chain that brought them to the present moment&mdash;they
<i>knew</i>; and Millicent felt that they knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are <i>you</i> going to be married to-morrow?&rdquo; asked
Guy Oscard deliberately.&nbsp; He never was a man to whom a successful
appeal for the slightest mitigation of justice could have been made.&nbsp;
His dealings had ever been with men, from whom he had exacted as scrupulous
an honour as he had given.&nbsp; He did not know that women are different&mdash;that
honour is not their strong point.</p>
<p>Millicent did not answer.&nbsp; She looked to Meredith to answer
for her; but Meredith was looking at Oscard, and in his lazy eyes there
glowed the singular affection and admiration which he had bestowed long
time before on this simple gentleman&mdash;his mental inferior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are <i>you</i> going to be married to-morrow?&rdquo; repeated
Oscard, standing quite still, with a calmness that frightened her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered rather feebly.</p>
<p>She knew that she could explain it all.&nbsp; She could have explained
it to either of them separately, but to both together, somehow it was
difficult.&nbsp; Her mind was filled with clamouring arguments and explanations
and plausible excuses; but she did not know which to select first.&nbsp;
None of them seemed quite equal to this occasion.&nbsp; These men required
something deeper, and stronger, and simpler than she had to offer them.</p>
<p>Moreover, she was paralysed by a feeling that was quite new to her&mdash;a
horrid feeling that something had gone from her.&nbsp; She had lost
her strongest, her single arm: her beauty.&nbsp; This seemed to have
fallen from her.&nbsp; It seemed to count for nothing at this time.&nbsp;
There is a time that comes as surely as death will come in the life
of every beautiful woman&mdash;a time wherein she suddenly realises
how trivial a thing her beauty is&mdash;how limited, how useless, how
ineffectual!</p>
<p>Millicent Chyne made a little appealing movement towards Meredith,
who relentlessly stepped back.&nbsp; It was the magic of the love that
filled his heart for Oscard.&nbsp; Had she wronged any man in the world
but Guy Oscard, that little movement&mdash;full of love and tenderness
and sweet contrition&mdash;might have saved her.&nbsp; But it was Oscard&rsquo;s
heart that she had broken; for broken they both knew it to be, and Jack
Meredith stepped back from her touch as from pollution.&nbsp; His superficial,
imagined love for her had been killed at a single blow.&nbsp; Her beauty
was no more to him at that moment than the beauty of a picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack!&rdquo; she gasped; and had there been another woman
in the room that woman would have known that Millicent loved him with
the love that comes once only.&nbsp; But men are not very acute in such
matters&mdash;they either read wrong or not at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all a mistake,&rdquo; she said breathlessly, looking
from one to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A most awkward mistake,&rdquo; suggested Meredith, with a
cruel smile that made her wince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Oscard must have mistaken me altogether,&rdquo; the girl
went on, volubly addressing herself to Meredith&mdash;she wanted nothing
from Oscard.&nbsp; &ldquo;I may have been silly, perhaps, or merely
ignorant and blind.&nbsp; How was I to know that he meant what he said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, indeed?&rdquo; agreed Meredith, with a grave bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides, he has no business to come here bringing false accusations
against me.&nbsp; He has no right&mdash;it is cruel and ungentlemanly.&nbsp;
He cannot prove anything; he cannot say that I ever distinctly gave
him to understand&mdash;er, anything&mdash;that I ever promised to be
engaged or anything like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned upon Oscard, whose demeanour was stolid, almost dense.&nbsp;
He looked very large and somewhat difficult to move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has not attempted to do so yet,&rdquo; suggested Jack suavely,
looking at his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not see that it is quite a question of proofs,&rdquo;
said Oscard quietly, in a voice that did not sound like his at all.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We are not in a court of justice, where ladies like to settle
these questions now.&nbsp; If we were I could challenge you to produce
my letters.&nbsp; There is no doubt of my meaning in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are also my poor contributions to&mdash;your collection,&rdquo;
chimed in Jack Meredith.&nbsp; &ldquo;A comparison must have been interesting
to you, by the same mail presumably, under the same postmark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made no comparison,&rdquo; the girl cried defiantly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There was no question of comparison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said it shamelessly, and it hurt Meredith more than it hurt Guy
Oscard, for whom the sting was intended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comparison or no comparison,&rdquo; said Jack Meredith quickly,
with the keenness of a good fencer who has been touched, &ldquo;there
can be no doubt of the fact that you were engaged to us both at the
same time.&nbsp; You told us both to go out and make a fortune wherewith
to buy&mdash;your affections.&nbsp; One can only presume that the highest
bidder&mdash;the owner of the largest fortune&mdash;was to be the happy
man.&nbsp; Unfortunately we became partners, and&mdash;such was the
power of your fascination&mdash;we made the fortune; but we share and
share alike in that.&nbsp; We are equal, so far as the&mdash;price is
concerned.&nbsp; The situation is interesting and rather&mdash;amusing.&nbsp;
It is your turn to move.&nbsp; We await your further instructions in
considerable suspense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stared at him with bloodless lips.&nbsp; She did not seem to
understand what he was saying.&nbsp; At last she spoke, ignoring Guy
Oscard&rsquo;s presence altogether.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Considering that we are to be married to-morrow, I do not
think that you should speak to me like that,&rdquo; she said with a
strange, concentrated eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, we are not going to be married to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her brilliant teeth closed on her lower lip with a snap, and she
stood looking at him, breathing so hard that the sound was almost a
sob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she whispered hoarsely.</p>
<p>He raised his shoulders in polite surprise at her dulness of comprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the unfortunate circumstances in which you are placed,&rdquo;
he explained, &ldquo;it seems to me that the least one can do is to
offer every assistance in one&rsquo;s power.&nbsp; Please consider me
<i>hors de concours</i>.&nbsp; In a word&mdash;I scratch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gasped like a swimmer swimming for life.&nbsp; She was fighting
for that which some deem dearer than life&mdash;namely, her love.&nbsp;
For it is not only the good women who love, though these understand
it best and see farther into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you can never have cared for me,&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;All that you have told me,&rdquo; and her eyes flashed triumphantly
across Oscard, &ldquo;all that you promised and vowed was utterly false&mdash;if
you turn against me at the first word of a man who was carried away
by his own vanity into thinking things that he had no business to think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Guy Oscard was no great adept at wordy warfare, he was at all
events strong in his reception of punishment.&nbsp; He stood upright
and quiescent, betraying by neither sign nor movement that her words
could hurt him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg to suggest again,&rdquo; said Jack composedly, &ldquo;that
Oscard has not yet brought any accusations against you.&nbsp; You have
brought them all yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are both cruel and cowardly,&rdquo; she exclaimed, suddenly
descending to vituperation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Two to one.&nbsp; Two men&mdash;<i>gentlemen</i>&mdash;against
one defenceless girl.&nbsp; Of course I am not able to argue with you.&nbsp;
Of course you can get the best of me.&nbsp; It is so easy to be sarcastic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not imagine,&rdquo; retorted Jack, &ldquo;that anything
that we can say or do will have much permanent power of hurting you.&nbsp;
For the last two years you have been engaged in an&mdash;intrigue, such
as a thin-skinned or sensitive person would hardly of her own free will
undertake.&nbsp; You may be able to explain it to yourself&mdash;no
doubt you are&mdash;but to our more limited comprehensions it must remain
inexplicable.&nbsp; We can only judge from appearances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And of course appearances go against me&mdash;they always
do against a woman,&rdquo; she cried rather brokenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would have been wise to have taken that peculiarity into
consideration sooner,&rdquo; replied Jack Meredith coldly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
admit that I am puzzled; I cannot quite get at your motive.&nbsp; Presumably
it is one of those&mdash;<i>sweet</i> feminine inconsistencies which
are so charming in books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little pause.&nbsp; Jack Meredith waited politely to
hear if she had anything further to say.&nbsp; His clean-cut face was
quite pallid; the suppressed anger in his eyes was perhaps more difficult
to meet than open fury.&nbsp; The man who never forgets himself before
a woman is likely to be an absolute master of women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that there is nothing more
to be said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a dead silence.&nbsp; Millicent Chyne glanced towards Guy
Oscard.&nbsp; He could have saved her yet&mdash;by a simple lie.&nbsp;
Had he been an impossibly magnanimous man, such as one meets in books
only, he could have explained that the mistake was all his, that she
was quite right, that his own vanity had blinded him into a great and
unwarranted presumption.&nbsp; But, unfortunately, he was only a human
being&mdash;a man who was ready to give as full a measure as he exacted.&nbsp;
The unfortunate mistake to which he clung was that the same sense of
justice, the same code of honour, must serve for men and women alike.&nbsp;
So Millicent Chyne looked in vain for that indulgence which is so inconsistently
offered to women, merely because they are women&mdash;the indulgence
which is sometimes given and sometimes withheld, according to the softness
of the masculine heart and the beauty of the suppliant feminine form.&nbsp;
Guy Oscard was quite sure of his own impressions.&nbsp; This girl had
allowed him to begin loving her, had encouraged him to go on, had led
him to believe that his love was returned.&nbsp; And in his simple ignorance
of the world he did not see why these matters should be locked up in
his own breast from a mistaken sense of chivalry to be accorded where
no chivalry was due.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is nothing more
to be said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without looking towards her, Jack Meredith made a few steps towards
the door&mdash;quietly, self-composedly, with that perfect <i>savoir-faire</i>
of the social expert that made him different from other men.&nbsp; Millicent
Chyne felt a sudden plebeian desire to scream.&nbsp; It was all so heartlessly
well-bred.&nbsp; He turned on his heel with a little half-cynical bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I leave my name with you,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is probable that you will be put to some inconvenience.&nbsp; I can
only regret that this&mdash;<i>d&eacute;nouement</i> did not come some
months ago.&nbsp; You are likely to suffer more than I, because I do
not care what the world thinks of me.&nbsp; Therefore you may tell the
world what you choose about me&mdash;that I drink, that I gamble, that
I am lacking in&mdash;honour!&nbsp; Anything that suggests itself to
you, in fact.&nbsp; You need not go away; I will do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She listened with compressed lips and heaving shoulders; and the
bitterest drop in her cup was the knowledge that he despised her.&nbsp;
During the last few minutes he had said and done nothing that lowered
him in her estimation&mdash;that touched in any way her love for him.&nbsp;
He had not lowered himself in any way, but he had suavely trodden her
under foot.&nbsp; His last words&mdash;the inexorable intention of going
away&mdash;sapped her last lingering hope.&nbsp; She could never regain
even a tithe of his affection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that you will agree with
me in thinking that Guy Oscard&rsquo;s name must be kept out of this
entirely.&nbsp; I give you <i>carte blanche</i> except that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a slight inclination of the head he walked to the door.&nbsp;
It was characteristic of him that although he walked slowly he never
turned his head nor paused.</p>
<p>Oscard followed him with the patient apathy of the large and mystified.</p>
<p>And so they left her&mdash;amidst the disorder of the half-unpacked
wedding presents&mdash;amidst the ruin of her own life.&nbsp; Perhaps,
after all, she was not wholly bad.&nbsp; Few people are; they are only
bad enough to be wholly unsatisfactory and quite incomprehensible.&nbsp;
She must have known the risk she was running, and yet she could not
stay her hand.&nbsp; She must have known long before that she loved
Jack Meredith, and that she was playing fast and loose with the happiness
of her whole life.&nbsp; She knew that hundreds of girls around her
were doing the same, and, with all shame be it mentioned, not a few
married women.&nbsp; But they seemed to be able to carry it through
without accident or hindrance.&nbsp; And illogically, thoughtlessly,
she blamed her own ill-fortune.</p>
<p>She stood looking blankly at the door which had closed behind three
men&mdash;one old and two young&mdash;and perhaps she realised the fact
that such creatures may be led blindly, helplessly, with a single hair,
but that that hair may snap at any moment.</p>
<p>She was not thinking of Guy Oscard.&nbsp; Him she had never loved.&nbsp;
He had only been one of her experiments, and by his very simplicity&mdash;above
all, by his uncompromising honesty&mdash;he had outwitted her.</p>
<p>It was characteristic of her that at that moment she scarcely knew
the weight of her own remorse.&nbsp; It sat lightly on her shoulders
then, and it was only later on, when her beauty began to fade, when
years came and brought no joy for the middle-aged unmarried woman, that
she began to realise what it was that she had to carry through life
with her.&nbsp; At that moment a thousand other thoughts filled her
mind&mdash;such thoughts as one would expect to find there.&nbsp; How
was the world to be deceived?&nbsp; The guests would have to be put
off&mdash;the wedding countermanded&mdash;the presents returned.&nbsp;
And the world&mdash;her world&mdash;would laugh in its sleeve.&nbsp;
There lay the sting.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLII. A STRONG FRIENDSHIP</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Still must the man move sadlier
for the dreams<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That mocked the boy.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; asked Meredith, when they were
in the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked on a few paces together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I come with you?&rdquo; asked Meredith again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly; I have a good deal to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They called a cab, and singularly enough they drove all the way to
Russell Square without speaking.&nbsp; These two men had worked together
for many months, and men who have a daily task in common usually learn
to perform it without much interchange of observation.&nbsp; When one
man gets to know the mind of another, conversation assumes a place of
secondary importance.&nbsp; These two had been through more incidents
together than usually fall to the lot of man&mdash;each knew how the
other would act and think under given circumstances; each knew what
the other was thinking now.</p>
<p>The house in Russell Square, the quiet house in the corner where
the cabs do not pass, was lighted up and astir when they reached it.&nbsp;
The old butler held open the door with a smile of welcome and a faint
aroma of whisky.&nbsp; The luggage had been discreetly removed.&nbsp;
Joseph had gone to Mr. Meredith&rsquo;s chambers.&nbsp; Guy Oscard led
the way to the smoking-room at the back of the house&mdash;the room
wherein the eccentric Oscard had written his great history&mdash;the
room in which Victor Durnovo had first suggested the Simiacine scheme
to the historian&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>The two survivors of the originating trio passed into this room together,
and closed the door behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst of one&rsquo;s own private tragedies is that they
are usually only comedies in disguise,&rdquo; said Jack Meredith oracularly.</p>
<p>Guy Oscard grunted.&nbsp; He was looking for his pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we heard this of any two fellows except ourselves we should
think it an excellent joke,&rdquo; went on Meredith.</p>
<p>Oscard nodded.&nbsp; He lighted his pipe, and still he said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang it!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack Meredith, suddenly throwing
himself back in his chair, &ldquo;it is a good joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed softly, and all the while his eyes, watchful, wise, anxious,
were studying Guy Oscard&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is harder hit than I am,&rdquo; he was reflecting. &ldquo;Poor
old Oscard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The habit of self-suppression was so strong upon him&mdash;acquired
as a mere social duty&mdash;that it was only natural for him to think
less of himself than of the expediency of the moment.&nbsp; The social
discipline is as powerful an agent as that military discipline that
makes a man throw away his own life for the good of the many.</p>
<p>Oscard laughed, too, in a strangely staccato manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is rather a sudden change,&rdquo; observed Meredith; &ldquo;and
all brought about by your coming into that room at that particular moment&mdash;by
accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not by accident,&rdquo; corrected Oscard, speaking at last.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was brought there and pushed into the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack Meredith sat upright.&nbsp; He drew his curved hand slowly down
over his face&mdash;keen and delicate as was his mind&mdash;his eyes
deep with thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Guv&rsquo;nor,&rdquo; he said slowly.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Guv&rsquo;nor&mdash;by God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reflected for some seconds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me how he did it,&rdquo; he said curtly.</p>
<p>Oscard told him, rather incoherently, between the puffs.&nbsp; He
did not attempt to make a story of it, but merely related the facts
as they had happened to him.&nbsp; It is probable that to him the act
was veiled which Jack saw quite distinctly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the sort of thing,&rdquo; was Meredith&rsquo;s comment
when the story was finished, &ldquo;that takes the conceit out of a
fellow.&nbsp; I suppose I have more than my share.&nbsp; I suppose it
is good for me to find that I am not so clever as I thought I was&mdash;that
there are plenty of cleverer fellows about, and that one of them is
an old man of seventy-nine.&nbsp; The worst of it is that he was right
all along.&nbsp; He saw clearly where you and I were&mdash;damnably
blind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rubbed his slim brown hands together, and looked across at his
companion with a smile wherein the youthful self-confidence was less
discernible than of yore.&nbsp; The smile faded as he looked at Oscard.&nbsp;
He was thinking that he looked older and graver&mdash;more of a middle-aged
man who has left something behind him in life&mdash;and the sight reminded
him of the few grey hairs that were above his own temples.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said more cheerfully, &ldquo;tell me your
news.&nbsp; Let us change the subject.&nbsp; Let us throw aside light
dalliance and return to questions of money.&nbsp; More important&mdash;much
more satisfactory.&nbsp; I suppose you have left Durnovo in charge?&nbsp;
Has Joseph come home with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Joseph has come home with me.&nbsp; Durnovo is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy Oscard took his pipe from his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He died at Msala of the sleeping sickness.&nbsp; He was a
bigger blackguard than we thought.&nbsp; He was a slave-dealer and a
slave-owner.&nbsp; Those forty men we picked up at Msala were slaves
belonging to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ach!&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a strange exclamation, as if he had
burnt his fingers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who knows of this?&rdquo; he asked immediately.&nbsp;
The expediency of the moment had presented itself to his mind again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only ourselves,&rdquo; returned Oscard.&nbsp; &ldquo;You,
Joseph, and I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all right, and the sooner we forget that the better.&nbsp;
It would be a dangerous story to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I concluded,&rdquo; said Oscard, in his slow, thoughtful
way.&nbsp; &ldquo;Joseph swears he won&rsquo;t breathe a word of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack Meredith nodded.&nbsp; He looked rather pale beneath the light
of the gas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joseph is all right,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Joseph who found it out,&rdquo; continued Oscard, &ldquo;up
at the Plateau.&nbsp; I paraded the whole crowd, told them what I had
found out, and chucked up the whole concern in your name and mine.&nbsp;
Next morning I abandoned the Plateau with such men as cared to come.&nbsp;
Nearly half of them stayed with Durnovo.&nbsp; I thought it was in order
that they might share in the Simiacine&mdash;I told them they could
have the whole confounded lot of the stuff.&nbsp; But it was not that;
they tricked Durnovo there.&nbsp; They wanted to get him to themselves.&nbsp;
In going down the river we had an accident with two of the boats, which
necessitated staying at Msala.&nbsp; While we were waiting there, one
night after ten o&rsquo;clock the poor devil came, alone, in a canoe.&nbsp;
They had simply cut him in slices&mdash;a most beastly sight.&nbsp;
I wake up sometimes even now dreaming of it, and I am not a fanciful
sort of fellow.&nbsp; Joseph went into his room and was simply sick;
I didn&rsquo;t know that you could be made sick by anything you saw.&nbsp;
The sleeping sickness was on Durnovo then; he had brought it with him
from the Plateau.&nbsp; He died before morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oscard ceased speaking and returned to his pipe.&nbsp; Jack Meredith,
looking haggard and worn, was leaning back in his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor devil!&rdquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;There was always
something tragic about Durnovo.&nbsp; I did hate that man, Oscard.&nbsp;
I hated him and all his works.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s gone to his account now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but that does not make him any better a man while he
was alive.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let us cant about him now.&nbsp; The man
was an unmitigated scoundrel&mdash;perhaps he deserved all he got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he did.&nbsp; He was Marie&rsquo;s husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil he was!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meredith fell into a long reverie.&nbsp; He was thinking of Jocelyn
and her dislike for Durnovo, of the scene in the drawing-room of the
bungalow at Loango; of a thousand incidents all connected with Jocelyn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How I hate that man!&rdquo; he exclaimed at length.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thank God&mdash;he is dead&mdash;because I should have killed
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy Oscard looked at him with a slow pensive wonder.&nbsp; Perhaps
he knew more than Jack Meredith knew himself of the thoughts that conceived
those words&mdash;so out of place in that quiet room, from those suave
and courtly lips.</p>
<p>All the emotions of his life seemed to be concentrated into this
one day of Jack Meredith&rsquo;s existence.&nbsp; Oscard&rsquo;s presence
was a comfort to him&mdash;the presence of a calm, strong man is better
than many words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is the end of the Simiacine.&nbsp;
It did not look like a tragedy when we went into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far as I am concerned,&rdquo; replied Oscard, with quiet
determination, &ldquo;it certainly is the end of the Simiacine!&nbsp;
I have had enough of it.&nbsp; I, for one, am not going to look for
that Plateau again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I.&nbsp; I suppose it will be started as a limited liability
company by a German in six months.&nbsp; Some of the natives will leave
landmarks as they come down so as to find their way back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oscard took his pipe from his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Durnovo came down to Msala,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;he
had the sleeping sickness on him.&nbsp; Where did he get it from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By God!&rdquo; ejaculated Jack Meredith, &ldquo;I never thought
of that.&nbsp; He got it up at the Plateau.&nbsp; He left it behind
him.&nbsp; They have got it up there now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Oscard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merely that all those fellows up there are dead.&nbsp; There
is ninety thousand pounds worth of Simiacine packed ready for carrying
to the coast, standing in a pile on the Plateau, and there are thirty-four
dead men keeping watch over it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it as infectious as that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When it first shows itself, infectious is not the word.&nbsp;
It is nothing but a plague.&nbsp; Not one of those fellows can have
escaped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack Meredith sat forward and rubbed his two hands pensively over
his knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;only you and I and Joseph know
where the Simiacine Plateau is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so,&rdquo; answered Oscard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Joseph won&rsquo;t go back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if you were to give him that ninety thousand pounds worth
of stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will not go back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for nine hundred thousand pounds.&nbsp; There is a curse
on that place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe there is,&rdquo; said Meredith.</p>
<p>And such was the end of the great Simiacine Scheme&mdash;the wonder
of a few seasons.&nbsp; Some day, when the great Sahara is turned into
an inland sea, when steamers shall ply where sand now flies before the
desert wind, the Plateau may be found again.&nbsp; Some day, when Africa
is cut from east to west by a railway line, some adventurous soul will
scale the height of one of many mountains, one that seems no different
from the rest and yet is held in awe by the phantom-haunted denizens
of the gloomy forest, and there he will find a pyramid of wooden cases
surrounded by bleached and scattered bones where vultures have fed.</p>
<p>In the meantime the precious drug will grow scarcer day by day, and
the human race will be poorer by the loss of one of those half-matured
discoveries which have more than once in the world&rsquo;s history been
on the point of raising the animal called man to a higher, stronger,
finer development of brain and muscle than we can conceive of under
existing circumstances.&nbsp; Who can tell?&nbsp; Perhaps the strange
solitary bush may be found growing elsewhere&mdash;in some other continent
across the ocean.&nbsp; The ways of Nature are past comprehension, and
no man can say who sows the seed that crops up in strange places.&nbsp;
The wind bloweth where it listeth, and none can tell what germs it bears.&nbsp;
It seems hardly credible that the Plateau, no bigger than a cricket
field, far away in the waste land of Central Africa, can be the only
spot on this planet where the magic leaf grows in sufficient profusion
to supply suffering humanity with an alleviating drug, unrivalled&mdash;a
strength-giving herb, unapproached in power.&nbsp; But as yet no other
Simiacine has been found and the Plateau is lost.</p>
<p>And the end of it was two men who had gone to look for it two years
before&mdash;young and hearty&mdash;returning from the search successful
beyond their highest hopes, with a shadow in their eyes and grey upon
their heads.</p>
<p>They sat for nearly two hours in that room in the quiet house in
Russell Square, where the cabs do not pass; and their conversation was
of money.&nbsp; They sat until they had closed the Simiacine account,
never to be reopened.&nbsp; They discussed the question of renouncement,
and, after due consideration, concluded that the gain was rightly theirs
seeing that the risk had all been theirs.&nbsp; Slaves and slave-owner
had both taken their cause to a Higher Court, where the defendant has
no worry and the plaintiff is at rest.&nbsp; They were beyond the reach
of money&mdash;beyond the glitter of gold&mdash;far from the cry of
anguish.&nbsp; A fortune was set aside for Marie Durnovo, to be held
in trust for the children of the man who had found the Simiacine Plateau;
another was apportioned to Joseph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seventy-seven thousand one hundred and four pounds for you,&rdquo;
said Jack Meredith at length, laying aside his pen, &ldquo;seventy-seven
thousand one hundred and four pounds for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; he added, after a little pause, &ldquo;it was
not worth it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy Oscard smoked his pipe and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Jack Meredith, &ldquo;I must go.&nbsp; I
must be out of London by to-morrow morning.&nbsp; I shall go abroad&mdash;America
or somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose as he spoke, and Oscard made no attempt to restrain him.</p>
<p>They went out into the passage together.&nbsp; Oscard opened the
door and followed his companion to the step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Meredith, &ldquo;we shall meet some
time&mdash;somewhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They shook hands.</p>
<p>Jack Meredith went down the steps almost reluctantly.&nbsp; At the
foot of the short flight he turned and looked up at the strong, peaceful
form of his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall go back to my big-game,&rdquo; replied Guy Oscard.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am best at that.&nbsp; But I shall not go to Africa.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIII.&nbsp; A LONG DEBT</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The life unlived, the deed undone,
the tear<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unshed.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather expect&mdash;Lady Cantourne,&rdquo; said Sir John
to his servants when he returned home, &ldquo;any time between now and
ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The butler, having a vivid recollection of an occasion when Lady
Cantourne was shown into a drawing-room where there were no flowers,
made his preparations accordingly.&nbsp; The flowers were set out with
that masculine ignorance of such matters which brings a smile&mdash;not
wholly of mirth&mdash;to a woman&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; The little-used
drawing-room was brought under the notice of the housekeeper for that
woman&rsquo;s touch which makes a drawing-room what it is.&nbsp; It
was always ready&mdash;this room, though Sir John never sat in it.&nbsp;
But for Lady Cantourne it was always more than ready.</p>
<p>Sir John went to the library and sat rather wearily down in the stiff-backed
chair before the fire.&nbsp; He began by taking up the evening newspaper,
but failed to find his eyeglasses, which had twisted up in some aggravating
manner with his necktie.&nbsp; So he laid aside the journal and gave
way to the weakness of looking into the fire.</p>
<p>Once or twice his head dropped forward rather suddenly, so that his
clean-shaven chin touched his tie-pin, and this without a feeling of
sleepiness warranting the relaxation of the spinal column.&nbsp; He
sat up suddenly on each occasion and threw back his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost seems,&rdquo; he muttered once, &ldquo;as if I were
getting to be an old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that he remembered nothing until the butler, coming in with
the lamp, said that Lady Cantourne was in the drawing-room.&nbsp; The
man busied himself with the curtains, carefully avoiding a glance in
his master&rsquo;s direction.&nbsp; No one had ever found Sir John asleep
in a chair during the hours that other people watch, and this faithful
old servant was not going to begin to do so now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Sir John, surreptitiously composing his collar
and voluminous necktie, &ldquo;thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose and glanced at the clock.&nbsp; It was nearly seven.&nbsp;
He had slept through the most miserable hour of Millicent Chyne&rsquo;s
life.</p>
<p>At the head of the spacious staircase he paused in front of the mirror,
half hidden behind exotics, and pressed down his wig behind either ear.&nbsp;
Then he went into the drawing-room.</p>
<p>Lady Cantourne was standing impatiently on the hearthrug, and scarcely
responded to his bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Jack been here?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stamped a foot, still neat despite its long journey over a road
that had never been very smooth.&nbsp; Her manner was that of a commander-in-chief,
competent but unfortunate, in the midst of a great reverse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has not been here this afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Sir John, closing the door behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have not heard anything from him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word.&nbsp; As you know, I am not fortunate enough to
be fully in his confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Cantourne glanced round the room as if looking for some object
upon which to fix her attention.&nbsp; It was a characteristic movement
which he knew, although he had only seen it once or twice before.&nbsp;
It indicated that if there was an end to Lady Cantourne&rsquo;s wit,
she had almost reached that undesirable bourne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has broken off his engagement,&rdquo; she said, looking
her companion very straight in the face, &ldquo;<i>now</i>&mdash;at
the eleventh hour.&nbsp; Do you know anything about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She came closer to him, looking up from her compact little five-feet-two
with discerning eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>She came still nearer and laid her gloved hands upon his sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John! you know something about this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to know more,&rdquo; he said suavely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am afraid&mdash;Millicent will be inconvenienced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Cantourne looked keenly at him for a moment.&nbsp; Physically
she almost stood on tip-toe, mentally she did it without disguise.&nbsp;
Then she turned away and sat on a chair which had always been set apart
for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a question,&rdquo; she said gravely, &ldquo;whether
any one has a right to punish a woman so severely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corner of Sir John&rsquo;s mouth twitched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather punish her than have Jack punished for the
rest of his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Et moi</i>?&rdquo; she snapped impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; with a gesture learnt in some foreign court, &ldquo;I
can only ask your forgiveness.&nbsp; I can only remind you that she
is not your daughter&mdash;if she were she would be a different woman&mdash;while
he <i>is</i> my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Cantourne nodded as if to indicate that he need explain no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you do it?&rdquo; she asked quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not do it.&nbsp; I merely suggested to Guy Oscard that
he should call on you.&nbsp; Millicent and her <i>fianc&eacute;</i>&mdash;the
other&mdash;were alone in the drawing-room when we arrived.&nbsp; Thinking
that I might be <i>de trop</i> I withdrew, and left the young people
to settle it among themselves, which they have apparently done!&nbsp;
I am, like yourself, a great advocate for allowing young people to settle
things among themselves.&nbsp; They are also welcome to their enjoyment
of the consequences so far as I am concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Millicent was never engaged to Guy Oscard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she tell you so?&rdquo; asked Sir John, with a queer smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you believed her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course&mdash;and you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John smiled his courtliest smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always believe a lady,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;before
her face.&nbsp; Mr. Guy Oscard gave it out in Africa that he was engaged
to be married, and he even declared that he was returning home to be
married.&nbsp; Jack did the same in every respect.&nbsp; Unfortunately
there was only one fond heart waiting for the couple of them at home.&nbsp;
That is why I thought it expedient to give the young people an opportunity
of settling it between themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The smile left his worn old face.&nbsp; He moved uneasily and walked
to the fireplace, where he stood with his unsteady hands moving idly,
almost nervously, among the ornaments on the mantelpiece.&nbsp; He committed
the rare discourtesy of almost turning his back upon a lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must ask you to believe,&rdquo; he said, looking anywhere
but at her, &ldquo;that I did not forget you in the matter.&nbsp; I
may seem to have acted with an utter disregard for your feelings&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off suddenly, and, turning, he stood on the hearthrug with
his feet apart, his hands clasped behind his back, his head slightly
bowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I drew on the reserve of an old friendship,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You were kind enough to say the other day that you were indebted
to me to some extent.&nbsp; You are indebted to me to a larger extent
than you perhaps realise.&nbsp; You owe me fifty years of happiness&mdash;fifty
years of a life that might have been happy had you decided differently
when&mdash;when we were younger.&nbsp; I do not blame you now&mdash;I
never have blamed you.&nbsp; But the debt is there&mdash;you know my
life, you know almost every day of it&mdash;you cannot deny the debt.&nbsp;
I drew upon that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the white-haired woman raised her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said gently, &ldquo;please don&rsquo;t
say any more.&nbsp; I know all that your life has been, and why.&nbsp;
You did quite right.&nbsp; What is a little trouble to me, a little
passing inconvenience, the tattle of a few idle tongues, compared with
what Jack&rsquo;s life is to you?&nbsp; I see now that I ought to have
opposed it strongly instead of letting it take its course.&nbsp; You
were right&mdash;you always have been right, John.&nbsp; There is a
sort of consolation in the thought.&nbsp; I like it.&nbsp; I like to
think that you were always right and that it was I who was wrong.&nbsp;
It confirms my respect for you.&nbsp; We shall get over this somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young lady,&rdquo; suggested Sir John, &ldquo;will get
over it after the manner of her kind.&nbsp; She will marry some one
else, let us hope, before her wedding-dress goes out of fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Millicent will have to get over it as she may.&nbsp; Her feelings
need scarcely be taken into consideration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Cantourne made a little movement towards the door.&nbsp; There
was much to see to&mdash;much of that women&rsquo;s work which makes
weddings the wild, confused ceremonies that they are.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; said Sir John, &ldquo;that I never thought
of taking them into consideration.&nbsp; As you know, I hardly considered
yours.&nbsp; I hope I have not overdrawn that reserve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had crossed the room as he spoke to open the door for her.&nbsp;
His fingers were on the handle, but he did not turn it, awaiting her
answer.&nbsp; She did not look at him, but past him towards the shaded
lamp with that desire to fix her attention upon some inanimate object
which he knew of old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reserve,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;will stand more than
that.&nbsp; It has accumulated&mdash;with compound interest.&nbsp; But
I deny the debt of which you spoke just now.&nbsp; There is no debt.&nbsp;
I have paid it, year by year, day by day.&nbsp; For each one of those
fifty years of unhappiness I have paid a year&mdash;of regret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened the door and she passed out into the brilliantly lighted
passage and down the stairs, where the servants were waiting to open
the door and help her to her carriage.</p>
<p>Sir John did not go downstairs with her.</p>
<p>Later on he dined in his usual solitary grandeur.&nbsp; He was as
carefully dressed as ever.&nbsp; The discipline of his household&mdash;like
the discipline under which he held himself&mdash;was unrelaxed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What wine is this?&rdquo; he asked when he had tasted the
port.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yellow seal, sir,&rdquo; replied the butler confidentially.</p>
<p>Sir John sipped again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a new bin,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&nbsp; First bottle of the lower bin, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John nodded with an air of self-satisfaction.&nbsp; He was pleased
to have proved to himself and to the &ldquo;damned butler,&rdquo; who
had caught him napping in the library, that he was still a young man
in himself, with senses and taste unimpaired.&nbsp; But his hand was
at the small of his back as he returned to the library.</p>
<p>He was not at all sure about Jack&mdash;did not know whether to expect
him or not.&nbsp; Jack did not always do what one might have expected
him to do under given circumstances.&nbsp; And Sir John rather liked
him for it.&nbsp; Perhaps it was that small taint of heredity which
is in blood, and makes it thicker than water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing like blood, sir,&rdquo; he was in the habit of saying,
&ldquo;in horses, dogs, and men.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thereafter he usually
threw back his shoulders.</p>
<p>The good blood that ran in his veins was astir to-night.&nbsp; The
incidents of the day had aroused him from the peacefulness that lies
under a weight of years (we have to lift the years one by one and lay
them aside before we find it), and Sir John Meredith would have sat
very upright in his chair were it not for that carping pain in his back.</p>
<p>He waited for an hour with his eyes almost continually on the clock,
but Jack never came.&nbsp; Then he rang the bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coffee,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I like punctuality, if
you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought Mr. Meredith might be expected, sir,&rdquo; murmured
the butler humbly.</p>
<p>Sir John was reading the evening paper, or appearing to read it,
although he had not his glasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oblige me by refraining from thought,&rdquo; he said urbanely.</p>
<p>So the coffee was brought, and Sir John consumed it in silent majesty.&nbsp;
While he was pouring out his second cup&mdash;of a diminutive size&mdash;the
bell rang.&nbsp; He set down the silver coffee-pot with a clatter, as
if his nerves were not quite so good as they used to be.&nbsp; It was
not Jack, but a note from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;MY DEAR FATHER,&mdash;Circumstances have necessitated the
breaking off of my engagement at the last moment.&nbsp; To-morrow&rsquo;s
ceremony will not take place.&nbsp; As the above-named circumstances
were partly under your control, I need hardly offer an explanation.&nbsp;
I leave town and probably England to-night.&mdash;I am, your affectionate
son,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;JOHN
MEREDITH.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were no signs of haste or discomposure.&nbsp; The letter was
neatly written in the somewhat large calligraphy, firm, bold, ornate,
which Sir John had insisted on Jack&rsquo;s learning.&nbsp; The stationery
bore a club crest.&nbsp; It was an eminently gentlemanly communication.&nbsp;
Sir John read it and gravely tore it up, throwing it into the fire,
where he watched it burn.</p>
<p>Nothing was farther from his mind than sentiment.&nbsp; He was not
much given to sentiment, this hard-hearted old sire of an ancient stock.&nbsp;
He never thought of the apocryphal day when he, being laid in his grave,
should at last win the gratitude of his son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I am dead and gone you may be sorry for it&rdquo; were
not the words that any man should hear from his lips.</p>
<p>More than once during their lives Lady Cantourne had said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never change your mind, John,&rdquo; referring to one
thing or another.&nbsp; And he had invariably answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am not the sort of man to change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had always known his own mind.&nbsp; When he had been in a position
to rule he had done so with a rod of iron.&nbsp; His purpose had ever
been inflexible.&nbsp; Jack had been the only person who had ever openly
opposed his desire.&nbsp; In this, as in other matters, his indomitable
will had carried the day, and in the moment of triumph it is only the
weak who repine.&nbsp; Success should have no disappointment for the
man who has striven for it if his will be strong.</p>
<p>Sir John rather liked the letter.&nbsp; It could only have been written
by a son of his&mdash;admitting nothing, not even defeat.&nbsp; But
he was disappointed.&nbsp; He had hoped that Jack would come&mdash;that
some sort of a reconciliation would be patched up.&nbsp; And somehow
the disappointment affected him physically.&nbsp; It attacked him in
the back, and intensified the pain there.&nbsp; It made him feel weak
and unlike himself.&nbsp; He rang the bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go round,&rdquo; he said to the butler, &ldquo;to Dr. Damer,
and ask him to call in during the evening if he has time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The butler busied himself with the coffee tray, hesitating, desirous
of gaining time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything wrong, sir?&nbsp; I hope you are not feeling ill,&rdquo;
he said nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ill, sir,&rdquo; cried Sir John.&nbsp; &ldquo;D&mdash;n it,
no; do I look ill?&nbsp; Just obey my orders if you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>My
faith is large in Time,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that

<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;MY DEAR JACK,&mdash;At the risk of being considered an interfering
old woman, I write to ask you whether you are not soon coming to England
again.&nbsp; As you are aware, your father and I knew each other as
children.&nbsp; We have known each other ever since&mdash;we are now
almost the only survivors of our generation.&nbsp; My reason for troubling
you with this communication is that during the last six months I have
noticed a very painful change in your father.&nbsp; He is getting very
old&mdash;he has no one but servants about him.&nbsp; You know his manner&mdash;it
is difficult for any one to approach him, even for me.&nbsp; If you
could come home&mdash;by accident&mdash;I think that you will never
regret it in after life.&nbsp; I need not suggest discretion as to this
letter.&nbsp; Your affectionate friend,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;CAROLINE
CANTOURNE.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack Meredith read this letter in the coffee-room of the Hotel of
the Four Seasons at Wiesbaden.&nbsp; It was a lovely morning&mdash;the
sun shone down through the trees of the Friedrichstrasse upon that spotless
pavement, of which the stricken wot; the fresh breeze came bowling down
from the Taunus mountains all balsamic and invigorating&mdash;it picked
up the odours of the Seringa and flowering currant in the Kurgarten,
and threw itself in at the open window of the coffee-room of the Hotel
of the Four Seasons.</p>
<p>Jack Meredith was restless.&nbsp; Such odours as are borne on the
morning breeze are apt to make those men restless who have not all that
they want.&nbsp; And is not their name legion?&nbsp; The morning breeze
is to the strong the moonlight of the sentimental.&nbsp; That which
makes one vaguely yearn incites the other to get up and take.</p>
<p>By the train leaving Wiesbaden for Cologne, &ldquo;over Mainz,&rdquo;
as the guide-book hath it, Jack Meredith left for England, in which
country he had not set foot for fifteen months.&nbsp; Guy Oscard was
in Cashmere; the Simiacine was almost forgotten as a nine days&rsquo;
wonder except by those who live by the ills of mankind.&nbsp; Millicent
Chyne had degenerated into a restless society &ldquo;hack.&rdquo;&nbsp;
With great skill she had posed as a martyr.&nbsp; She had allowed it
to be understood that she, having remained faithful to Jack Meredith
through his time of adversity, had been heartlessly thrown over when
fortune smiled upon him and there was a chance of his making a more
brilliant match.&nbsp; With a chivalry which was not without a keen
shaft of irony, father and son allowed this story to pass uncontradicted.&nbsp;
Perhaps a few believed it; perhaps they had foreseen the future.&nbsp;
It may have been that they knew that Millicent Chyne, surrounded by
the halo of whatever story she might invent, would be treated with a
certain careless nonchalance by the older men, with a respectful avoidance
by the younger.&nbsp; Truly women have the deepest punishment for their
sins here on earth; for sooner or later the time will come&mdash;after
the brilliancy of the first triumph, after the less pure satisfaction
of the skilled siren&mdash;the time will come when all that they want
is an enduring, honest love.&nbsp; And it is written that an enduring
love cannot, with the best will in the world, be bestowed on an unworthy
object.&nbsp; If a woman wishes to be loved purely she must have a pure
heart, and <i>no past</i>, ready for the reception of that love.&nbsp;
This is a <i>sine qu&acirc; non</i>.&nbsp; The woman with a past has
no future.</p>
<p>The short March day was closing in over London with that murky suggestion
of hopelessness affected by metropolitan eventide when Jack Meredith
presented himself at the door of his father&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>In his reception by the servants there was a subtle suggestion of
expectation which was not lost on his keen mind.&nbsp; There is no patience
like that of expectation in an old heart.&nbsp; Jack Meredith felt vaguely
that he had been expected thus, daily for many months past.</p>
<p>He was shown into the library, and the tall form standing there on
the hearthrug had not the outline for which he had looked.&nbsp; The
battle between old age and a stubborn will is long.&nbsp; But old age
wins.&nbsp; It never raises the siege.&nbsp; It starves the garrison
out.&nbsp; Sir John Meredith&rsquo;s head seemed to have shrunk.&nbsp;
The wig did not fit at the back.&nbsp; His clothes, always bearing the
suggestion of emptiness, seemed to hang on ancient-given lines as if
the creases were well established.&nbsp; The clothes were old.&nbsp;
The fateful doctrine of not-worth-while had set in.</p>
<p>Father and son shook hands, and Sir John walked feebly to the stiff-backed
chair, where he sat down in shamefaced silence.&nbsp; He was ashamed
of his infirmities.&nbsp; His was the instinct of the dog that goes
away into some hidden corner to die.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to see you,&rdquo; he said, using his two hands
to push himself further back in his chair.</p>
<p>There was a little pause.&nbsp; The fire was getting low.&nbsp; It
fell together with a feeble, crumbling sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I put some coals on?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>A simple question&mdash;if you will.&nbsp; But it was asked by the
son in such a tone of quiet, filial submission, that a whole volume
could not contain all that it said to the old man&rsquo;s proud, unbending
heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my boy, do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the last six years were wiped away like evil writing from a slate.</p>
<p>There was no explanation.&nbsp; These two men were not of those who
explain themselves, and in the warmth of explanation say things which
they do not fully mean.&nbsp; The opinions that each had held during
the years they had left behind had perhaps been modified on both sides,
but neither sought details of the modification.&nbsp; They knew each
other now, and each respected the indomitable will of the other.</p>
<p>They inquired after each other&rsquo;s health.&nbsp; They spoke of
events of a common interest.&nbsp; Trifles of everyday occurrence seemed
to contain absorbing details.&nbsp; But it is the everyday occurrence
that makes the life.&nbsp; It was the putting on of the coals that reconciled
these two men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;you gave up your rooms
before you left England, did you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack drew forward his chair and put his feet out towards the fire.&nbsp;
It was marvellous how thoroughly at home he seemed to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; continued Sir John, &ldquo;where is your luggage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left it at the club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send along for it.&nbsp; Your room is&mdash;er, quite ready
for you.&nbsp; I shall be glad if you will make use of it as long as
you like.&nbsp; You will be free to come and go as if you were in your
own house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack nodded with a strange, twisted little smile, as if he were suffering
from cramp in the legs.&nbsp; It was cramp&mdash;at the heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I should like nothing better.&nbsp;
Shall I ring?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack rang, and they waited in the fading daylight without speaking.&nbsp;
At times Sir John moved his limbs, his hand on the arm of the chair
and his feet on the hearth-rug, with the jerky, half-restless energy
of the aged which is not pleasant to see.</p>
<p>When the servant came, it was Jack who gave the orders, and the butler
listened to them with a sort of enthusiasm.&nbsp; When he had closed
the door behind him he pulled down his waistcoat with a jerk, and as
he walked downstairs he muttered &ldquo;Thank &rsquo;eaven!&rdquo; twice,
and wiped away a tear from his bibulous eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you been doing with yourself since I saw you?&rdquo;
inquired Sir John conversationally when the door was closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been out to India&mdash;merely for the voyage.&nbsp;
I went with Oscard, who is out there still, after big-game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John Meredith nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like that man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he is tough.&nbsp;
I like tough men.&nbsp; He wrote me a letter before he went away.&nbsp;
It was the letter of&mdash;one gentleman to another.&nbsp; Is he going
to spend the rest of his life &lsquo;after big-game&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems rather like it.&nbsp; He is cut out for that sort
of life.&nbsp; He is too big for narrow streets and cramped houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And matrimony?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and matrimony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John was leaning forward in his chair, his two withered hands
clasped on his knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he said slowly, blinking at the fire, &ldquo;he
cared for that girl&mdash;more than you did, my boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Jack softly.</p>
<p>Sir John looked towards him, but he said nothing.&nbsp; His attitude
was interrogatory.&nbsp; There were a thousand questions in the turn
of his head, questions which one gentleman could not ask another.</p>
<p>Jack met his gaze.&nbsp; They were still wonderfully alike, these
two men, though one was in his prime while the other was infirm.&nbsp;
On each face there was the stamp of a long-drawn, silent pride; each
was a type of those haughty conquerors who stepped, mail-clad, on our
shore eight hundred years ago.&nbsp; Form and feature, mind and heart,
had been handed down from father to son, as great types are.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One may have the right feeling and bestow it by mistake on
the wrong person,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>Sir John&rsquo;s fingers were at his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said rather indistinctly, &ldquo;while the
right person is waiting for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack looked up sharply, as if he either had not heard or did not
understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the right person is waiting for it,&rdquo; repeated
Sir John deliberately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The right person&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jocelyn Gordon,&rdquo; exclaimed Sir John, &ldquo;is the right
person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack shrugged his shoulders and leant back so that the firelight
did not shine upon his face.&nbsp; &ldquo;So I found out eighteen months
ago,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when it was too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no such thing as too late for that,&rdquo; said Sir
John in his great wisdom.&nbsp; &ldquo;Even if you were both quite old
it would not be too late.&nbsp; I have known it for longer than you.&nbsp;
I found it out two years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack looked across the room into the keen, worldly-wise old face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From her.&nbsp; I found it out the moment she mentioned your
name.&nbsp; I conducted the conversation in such a manner that she had
frequently to say it, and whenever your name crossed her lips she&mdash;gave
herself away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack shook his head with an incredulous smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moreover,&rdquo; continued Sir John, &ldquo;I maintain that
it is not too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There followed a silence; both men seemed to be wrapped in thought,
the same thoughts with a difference of forty years of life in the method
of thinking them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not go to her with a lame story like that,&rdquo;
said Jack.&nbsp; &ldquo;I told her all about Millicent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is just a lame story like that that women understand,&rdquo;
answered Sir John.&nbsp; &ldquo;When I was younger I thought as you
do.&nbsp; I thought that a man must needs bring a clean slate to the
woman he asks to be his wife.&nbsp; It is only his hands that must be
clean.&nbsp; Women see deeper into these mistakes of ours than we do;
they see the good of them where we only see the wound to our vanity.&nbsp;
Sometimes one would almost be inclined to think that they prefer a few
mistakes in the past because it makes the present surer.&nbsp; Their
romance is a different thing from ours&mdash;it is a better thing, deeper
and less selfish.&nbsp; They can wipe the slate clean and never look
at it again.&nbsp; And the best of them&mdash;rather like the task.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack made no reply.&nbsp; Sir John Meredith&rsquo;s chin was resting
on his vast necktie.&nbsp; He was looking with failing eyes into the
fire.&nbsp; He spoke like one who was sure of himself&mdash;confident
in his slowly accumulated store of that knowledge which is not written
in books.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you oblige me?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Jack moved in his chair, but he made no answer.&nbsp; Sir John did
not indeed expect it.&nbsp; He knew his son too well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;go out to Africa and
take your lame story to Jocelyn just as it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a long silence.&nbsp; The old worn-out clock on the mantelpiece
wheezed and struck six.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Jack at length, &ldquo;I will go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John nodded his head with a sigh of relief.&nbsp; All, indeed,
comes to him who waits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen a good deal of life,&rdquo; he said suddenly,
arousing himself and sitting upright in the stiff-backed chair, &ldquo;here
and there in the world; and I have found that the happiest people are
those who began by thinking that it was too late.&nbsp; The romance
of youth is only fit to write about in books.&nbsp; It is too delicate
a fabric for everyday use.&nbsp; It soon wears out or gets torn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack did not seem to be listening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued Sir John, &ldquo;you must not waste
time.&nbsp; If I may suggest it, you will do well to go at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Jack, &ldquo;I will go in a month or
so.&nbsp; I should like to see you in a better state of health before
I leave you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John pulled himself together.&nbsp; He threw back his shoulders
and stiffened his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My health is excellent,&rdquo; he replied sturdily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Of course I am beginning to feel my years a little, but one must
expect to do that after&mdash;eh&mdash;er&mdash;sixty.&nbsp; <i>C&rsquo;est
la vie.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>He made a little movement of the hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;the sooner you go the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not like leaving you,&rdquo; persisted Jack.</p>
<p>Sir John laughed rather testily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is rather absurd,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I am accustomed
to being left.&nbsp; I have always lived alone.&nbsp; You will do me
a favour if you will go now and take your passage out to Africa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now&mdash;this evening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;at once.&nbsp; These offices close about half-past
six, I believe.&nbsp; You will just have time to do it before dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack rose and went towards the door.&nbsp; He went slowly, almost
reluctantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not trouble about me,&rdquo; said Sir John, &ldquo;I am
accustomed to being left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He repeated it when the door had closed behind his son.</p>
<p>The fire was low again.&nbsp; It was almost dying.&nbsp; The daylight
was fading every moment.&nbsp; The cinders fell together with a crumbling
sound, and a greyness crept into their glowing depths.&nbsp; The old
man sitting there made no attempt to add fresh fuel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am accustomed,&rdquo; he said, with a half-cynical smile,
&ldquo;to being left.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLV.&nbsp; THE TELEGRAM</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>How could it end in any other way?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You
called me, and I came home to your heart.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;They tell me, sir, that Missis Marie&mdash;that is, Missis
Durnovo&mdash;has gone back to her people at Sierra Leone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus spoke Joseph to his master one afternoon in March, not so many
years ago.&nbsp; They were on board the steamer <i>Bogamayo</i>, which
good vessel was pounding down the West Coast of Africa at her best speed.&nbsp;
The captain reckoned that he would be anchored at Loango by half-past
seven or eight o&rsquo;clock that evening.&nbsp; There were only seven
passengers on board, and dinner had been ordered an hour earlier for
the convenience of all concerned.&nbsp; Joseph was packing his master&rsquo;s
clothes in the spacious cabin allotted to him.&nbsp; The owners of the
steamer had thought it worth their while to make the finder of the Simiacine
as comfortable as circumstances allowed.&nbsp; The noise of that great
drug had directed towards the West Coast of Africa that floating scum
of ne&rsquo;er-do-welldom which is ever on the alert for some new land
of promise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo; asked Jack, drying his hands on
a towel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the stewards, sir&mdash;a man that was laid up at Sierra
Leone in the hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack Meredith paused for a moment before going on deck.&nbsp; He
looked out through the open porthole towards the blue shadow on the
horizon which was Africa&mdash;a country that he had never seen three
years before, and which had all along been destined to influence his
whole life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the best thing she could do,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is to be hoped that she will be happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, it is.&nbsp; She deserves it, if that goes for anything
in the heavenly reckonin&rsquo;.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a fine woman&mdash;a
good woman that, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joseph was folding a shirt very carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bit dusky,&rdquo; he said, smoothing out the linen folds
reflectively, &ldquo;but I shouldn&rsquo;t have minded that if I had
been a marryin&rsquo; man, but&mdash;but I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laid the shirt in the portmanteau and looked up.&nbsp; Jack Meredith
had gone on deck.</p>
<p>While Maurice and Jocelyn Gordon were still at dinner that same evening,
a messenger came announcing the arrival of the <i>Bogamayo</i> in the
roads.&nbsp; This news had the effect of curtailing the meal.&nbsp;
Maurice Gordon was liable to be called away at any moment thus by the
arrival of a steamer.&nbsp; It was not long before he rose from the
table and lighted a cigar preparatory to going down to his office, where
the captain of the steamer was by this time probably awaiting him.&nbsp;
It was a full moon, and the glorious golden light of the equatorial
night shone through the high trees like a new dawn.&nbsp; Hardly a star
was visible; even those of the southern hemisphere pale beside the southern
moon.</p>
<p>Maurice Gordon crossed the open space of cultivated garden and plunged
into the black shadow of the forest.&nbsp; His footsteps were inaudible.&nbsp;
Suddenly he ran almost into the arms of a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who the devil is that?&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meredith,&rdquo; answered a voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meredith&mdash;Jack Meredith, is that you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m blowed!&rdquo; exclaimed Maurice Gordon, shaking
hands&mdash;&ldquo;likewise glad.&nbsp; What brought you out here again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pleasure!&rdquo; replied Jack, with his face in the shade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pleasure! you&rsquo;ve come to the wrong place for that.&nbsp;
However, I&rsquo;ll let you find out that for yourself.&nbsp; Go on
to the bungalow; I&rsquo;ll be back in less than an hour.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll
find Jocelyn in the verandah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Maurice left her, Jocelyn went out into the verandah.&nbsp;
It was the beginning of the hot season.&nbsp; At midday the sun on his
journey northward no longer cast a shadow.&nbsp; Jocelyn could not go
out in the daytime at this period of the year.&nbsp; For fresh air she
had to rely upon a long, dreamy evening in the verandah.</p>
<p>She sat down in her usual chair, while the moonlight, red and glowing,
made a pattern on the floor and on her white dress with the shadows
of the creepers.&nbsp; The sea was very loud that night, rising and
falling like the breath of some huge sleeping creature.</p>
<p>Jocelyn Gordon fell into a reverie.&nbsp; Life was very dull at Loango.&nbsp;
There was too much time for thought and too little to think about.&nbsp;
This girl only had the past, and her past was all comprised in a few
months&mdash;the few months still known at Loango as the Simiacine year.&nbsp;
She had lapsed into a bad habit of thinking that her life was over,
that the daylight of it had waned, and that there was nothing left now
but the grey remainder of the evening.&nbsp; She was wondering now why
it had all come&mdash;why there had been any daylight at all.&nbsp;
Above these thoughts she wondered why the feeling was still in her heart
that Jack Meredith had not gone out of her life for ever.&nbsp; There
was no reason why she should ever meet him again.&nbsp; He was, so far
as she knew, married to Millicent Chyne more than a year ago, although
she had never seen the announcement of the wedding.&nbsp; He had drifted
into Loango and into her life by the merest accident, and now that the
Simiacine Plateau had been finally abandoned there was no reason why
any of the original finders should come to Loango again.</p>
<p>And the creepers were pushed aside by one who knew the method of
their growth.&nbsp; A silver glory of moonlight fell on the verandah
floor, and the man of whom she was thinking stood before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose, and they shook hands.&nbsp; They stood looking at each
other for a few moments, and a thousand things that had never been said
seemed to be understood between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why have you come?&rdquo; she asked abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell you a story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up with a sort of half smile, as if she suspected some
pleasantry of which she had not yet detected the drift.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A long story,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;which has not even
the merit of being amusing.&nbsp; Please sit down again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She obeyed him.</p>
<p>The curtain of hanging leaves and flowers had fallen into place again;
the shadowed tracery was on her dress and on the floor once more.</p>
<p>He stood in front of her and told her his story, as Sir John had
suggested.&nbsp; He threw no romance into it&mdash;attempted no extenuation&mdash;but
related the plain, simple facts of the last few years with the semi-cynical
suggestion of humour that was sometimes his.&nbsp; And the cloak of
pride that had fallen upon his shoulders made him hide much that was
good, while he dragged forward his own shortcomings.&nbsp; She listened
in silence.&nbsp; At times there hovered round her lips a smile.&nbsp;
It usually came when he represented himself in a bad light, and there
was a suggestion of superior wisdom in it, as if she knew something
of which he was ignorant.</p>
<p>He was never humble.&nbsp; It was not a confession.&nbsp; It was
not even an explanation, but only a story&mdash;a very lame story indeed&mdash;which
gained nothing by the telling.&nbsp; And he was not the hero of it.</p>
<p>And all came about as wise old Sir John Meredith had predicted.&nbsp;
It is not our business to record what Jocelyn said.&nbsp; Women&mdash;the
best of them&mdash;have some things in their hearts which can only be
said once to one person.&nbsp; Men cannot write them down; printers
cannot print them.</p>
<p>The lame story was told to the end, and at the end it was accepted.&nbsp;
When Sir John&rsquo;s name was mentioned&mdash;when the interview in
the library of the great London house was briefly touched upon&mdash;Jack
saw the flutter of a small lace pocket-handkerchief, and at no other
time.&nbsp; The slate was wiped clean, and it almost seemed that Jocelyn
preferred it thus with the scratches upon it where the writing had been.</p>
<p>Maurice Gordon did not come back in an hour.&nbsp; It was nearly
ten o&rsquo;clock before they heard his footstep on the gravel.&nbsp;
By that time Jocelyn had heard the whole story.&nbsp; She had asked
one or two questions which somehow cast a different light upon the narrative,
and she had listened to the answers with a grave, judicial little smile&mdash;the
smile of a judge whose verdict was pre-ordained, whose knowledge had
nothing to gain from evidence.</p>
<p>Because she loved him she took his story and twisted it and turned
it to a shape of her own liking.&nbsp; Those items which he had considered
important she passed over as trifles; the trifles she magnified into
the corner-stones upon which the edifice was built.&nbsp; She set the
lame story upon its legs and it stood upright.&nbsp; She believed what
he had never told; and much that he related she chose to discredit&mdash;because
she loved him.&nbsp; She perceived motives where he assured her there
were none; she recognised the force of circumstances where he took the
blame to himself&mdash;because she loved him.&nbsp; She maintained that
the past was good, that he could not have acted differently, that she
would not have had it otherwise&mdash;because she loved him.</p>
<p>And who shall say that she was wrong?</p>
<p>Jack went out to meet Maurice Gordon when they heard his footsteps,
and as they walked back to the house he told him.&nbsp; Gordon was quite
honest about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hoped,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when I ran against you in
the wood, that that was why you had come back.&nbsp; Nothing could have
given me greater happiness.&nbsp; Hang it, I <i>am</i> glad, old chap!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat far into the night arranging their lives.&nbsp; Jack was
nervously anxious to get back to England.&nbsp; He could not rid his
mind of the picture he had seen as he left his father&rsquo;s presence
to go and take his passage to Africa&mdash;the picture of an old man
sitting in a stiff-backed chair before a dying fire.&nbsp; Moreover,
he was afraid of Africa; the Irritability of Africa had laid its hand
upon him almost as soon as he had set his foot upon its shore.&nbsp;
He was afraid of the climate for Jocelyn; he was afraid of it for himself.&nbsp;
The happiness that comes late must be firmly held to; nothing must be
forgotten to secure it, or else it may slip between the fingers at the
last moment.</p>
<p>Those who have snatched happiness late in life can tell of a thousand
details carefully attended to&mdash;a whole existence laid out in preparation
for it, of health fostered, small pleasures relinquished, days carefully
spent.</p>
<p>Jack Meredith was nervously apprehensive that his happiness might
even now slip through his fingers.&nbsp; Truly, climatic influence is
a strange and wonderful thing.&nbsp; It was Africa that had done this,
and he was conscious of it.&nbsp; He remembered Victor Durnovo&rsquo;s
strange outburst on their first meeting a few miles below Msala on the
Ogowe river, and the remembrance only made him the more anxious that
Jocelyn and he should turn their backs upon the accursed West Coast
for ever.</p>
<p>Before they went to bed that night it was all arranged.&nbsp; Jack
Meredith had carried his point.&nbsp; Maurice and Jocelyn were to sail
with him to England by the first boat.&nbsp; Jocelyn and he compiled
a telegram to be sent off first thing by a native boat to St. Paul de
Loanda.&nbsp; It was addressed to Sir John Meredith, London, and signed
&ldquo;Meredith, Loango.&rdquo;&nbsp; The text of it was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bring Jocelyn home by first boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .</p>
<p>And the last words, like the first, must be of an old man in London.&nbsp;
We found him in the midst of a brilliant assembly; we leave him alone.&nbsp;
We leave him lying stiffly on his solemn fourpost bed, with his keen,
proud face turned fearlessly towards his Maker.&nbsp; His lips are still;
they wear a smile which even in death is slightly cynical.&nbsp; On
the table at his bedside lies a submarine telegram from Africa.&nbsp;
It is unopened.</p>

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

We have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones
that have responded.

As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list
will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.
Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.

In answer to various questions we have received on this:

We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

Donations by check or money order may be sent to:

 PROJECT GUTENBERG LITERARY ARCHIVE FOUNDATION

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
